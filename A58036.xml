            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>bulwarks;</hi> but alſo with Seas and Sea-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders: You have many times in your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities ſtood in the breach to keep out an Enemy that would have flowed in upon us like a flood, if God had not by ſpiriting of you, lifted up a Standard againſt him; and what
<pb facs="tcp:100523:3"/> meſſage theſe following Papers have to you, is to call you, and excite you to further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of uſe and ſervice, that ſuch as have been honoured in doing ſervice for their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be honoured in being uſeful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and immortal Souls under their Charge and Command; which you may be by the Bleſſing of God, in holy, exemplary, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious walking in and out before your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: To which end, conſider but theſe few following Motives:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Your Command is great; and where God gives much, doth he not require much? Can you ſay to your Companies as the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion did to his Servants, Go, and he goes? and do they not readily obey you? and have you a word of command to do your buſineſs, and not one word of command for God, and their own Souls? It was ſaid by a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon once in high command; upon ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; Well, (ſaith he) if Soldiers, private Soldiers, miſcarry, I will make Commanders pay for it. I wiſh in the iſſue it prove not ſo in this caſe: You ſhould rule for God in your places.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your dangers are great; and will you, can you neglect your duty in time of danger? in a time of danger you will look out if there be fears of an Enemy, of a Rock, of a Sand: Soldiers neglect not their duty when beſieged with danger: You at Sea are beſieged with
<pb facs="tcp:100523:3"/> dangers, yea with deaths; as it was ſaid of Paul, he was in perils often by Sea; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had need with all your Companies, attend your duty towards God, towards one anothers Souls; this is the way to come off when beſet with dangers. Prayer hath brought many a Veſſel off, and Ships company off, when all hope of being ſaved hath been taken away.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your time looks as if it were ſhort; have not you of all men cauſe to reckon ſo? Can you enſure your lives, though you may your Veſſels, and your Ventures? hath God told you, you ſhall not miſcarry this Voyage? who can tell what is in the womb of To-morrow? then can any tell what is in the womb of a twelve months, or a twenty months Voyage? Can you promiſe your ſelves a return home from an <hi>Eaſt-Indie,</hi> or from a <hi>Guiny</hi> Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age? If you be ſecured from ſtorms at Sea, can you ſecure your ſelves from the Diſeaſes of the places and countries where you go? Oh then do good in your day, (which is like for any thing you know to be ſhort).</p>
            <p n="4">4. Your Reward will be great; your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will be great here, and hereafter. Your reward will be great here, <hi>Great peace have they which love thy Law: In keeping thy Commandments there is great reward.</hi> And when you come to die, either at Land, or Sea, you will be able to ſay with good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100523:4"/> 
               <hi>Lord, Remember how I have walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee in truth, and with a perfect heart:</hi> And hereafter, Oh what a Crown will it be if one Soul be converted under your charge, by your gracious carriage, and going in and out before them!</p>
            <p n="5">5. Your advantages and helps are great: you are advantaged with moſt excellent ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to do good to their Souls under your charge: Oh when Conſcience hath been work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your companies, in their ſtorms and dangers! what may not a word ſpoken at ſuch a time do upon their ſouls! when it may be the ſenſe of their eternal ſtates is freſh upon them, when it may be, Eternity is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; when it may be their hearts are tender with the ſenſe of deliverance from ſome terrible Tempeſt: Oh what good may your praying, your ſpeaking to them do at ſuch times? Do not you ſee the Wonders of the Lord in the deep, to affect your hearts? may not you ſay your eyes affect your hearts?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Your Obligations to God are great: Are any perſons under Heaven under ſuch Obligations as you are? When you go into the utmoſt parts of the Sea, doth not Gods hand lead you there? Do not you ſail under Gods eſpecial Protection? Is not his Banner over you love, from Voyage to Voyage? Is not he much out of Purſe (as I may ſay) upon you? Hath not he brought you out of the Jawes of
<pb facs="tcp:100523:4"/> Hell, and Death, many a time? Hath not he commanded many a ſtorm into a calm for your ſakes? Hath not he many a time ſaid to the raging Waves and Seas, Peace and be ſtill? Thus far, and no further? And will you thus requite the Lord, with evil for ſo much good? Is this your kindneſs to your friend? ſuch a friend as he hath been in a day of adverſity, to know your Souls in your diſtreſſes? Why ſhould your Souls ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo unkind?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Your Promiſes to God have been great: Oh the Vows that your lips have uttered to God in the day of your diſtreſs! what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations have come from you, when in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and eminent dangers? Are any men in ſo much debt to God as Seamen? are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes debts? when you pay your Vows, do not you pay your Debts? and is not the God of your Salvations, the God to whom the Vows ought to be performed? Oh then go on Sirs in your ſeveral capacities, to promote the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of that God who is the God of all your Deliverances. And do good to all under your command and charge, as opportunities preſent to you, that you may have the mercies of all that ſail with you to be given unto you, and never come under the judgment of having them that ſail with you to come in as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt you in the day of the Lord.</p>

            <p>I Cannot but with all the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities that I can, promote the honour of my dear Maſter, and the intereſt of precious Souls. I would by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, tears, intreaties, preaching, writing; be doing what I can poſſible to pluck poor Creatures out of the ſnares of Satan; and of all ſorts of men, poor Seamen have not the leaſt ſhare in my affections: I can I hope though in too low a degree yet ſpeak theſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> to you, <hi>Brethren my hearts deſire and prayer to God for your Souls is, that they may be ſaved.</hi> I know the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Soul is precious, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for ever, and ſhortly you will be out of the reach of my intreaties, and I expect e're long to put off this Tabernacle; the ſhortneſs of my breath, and the weakneſs of my body, cry aloud to me, What thou
<pb facs="tcp:100523:6"/> doſt do quickly, for ſhortly thou muſt be ſilent. I am not ignorant of the dangers that you grapple with every moment; methinks when I hear the wind begin to ruſtle, my heart begins to ake; fain would I do all that I can to ſecure you from an everlaſting wrack. I am not inſenſible how many temptations you meet with, and how much you are expoſed in thoſe hot Climates you trade in, and of what prevalency bad examples may be with ſome; I know alſo that the want of quickning Ordinances, and powerful preaching, when you are abroad, doth not a little hazzard the cooling of your affections to Spiritual things. I can't alſo but obſerve that a ſtrange hardneſs, ſtupidneſs, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs hath poſſeſſed moſt of your tribe. And who can chuſe but bewail the condition of men that live within ſight of death and eternity every hour, and yet carry it as if there were no other life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this; or as if their buſineſs here were to ſecure miſery and damnation hereafter. Oh what doth ſin make men! what ſots, mad men, and fools are moſt? and who worſe than ſome Seamen? who of all men living ſhould be moſt ſerious. They which carry their lives in their hands had need carry grace in their hearts.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:100523:6"/>
            <p> Oh what a ſad ſound it is to hear any of them ſwearing and curſing, and damning, who one would think ſhould be almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways praying, or praiſing of God! when I lay all theſe things together, and conſider how loud God himſelf hath ſpoke within theſe few years to poor Seamen, I could not but ſtrike in with Providence: It may be ſome may hear, and in this their day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the things of their peace before they be hid.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I will ſay nothing of the later ſtorms, and
<pb facs="tcp:100523:7"/> diſmal tempeſts, although I believe they are not eaſily to be parallel'd in ſome hundreds of years: I paſs by the miſerable captivity of others; and what ſtorms the tribe of Mariners may ſtill meet with, I will not now ſay. When I conſider what leiſure you have to read, when you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear, and how heart-affecting a warm diſcourſe may be to you when you have time to read and think, and read and ſee, and hear what is writ, and read and pray too; I can't but commend to your ſerious peruſal this judicious practical and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate piece of my reverend Brother.</p>
            <p>And now I have an opportunity give me leave to add a word or two more to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you to ſeriouſneſs, and let me leave theſe following lines as a witneſs of my hearty affections to you, which I beg of you to think of, when I am dead and gone. Again, I beſeech you as you love your Souls think of theſe enſuing Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider what a ſorry Veſſel you have under you, how brittle is that Bark that you are ſailing in; a little blaſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets it, a leak ſinks it, if it ſtrike upon the ground it's ſoon broken; I mean your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are poor frail things, and are ſoon ſhaken; you dwell in tabernacles of clay,
<pb facs="tcp:100523:7"/> whoſe foundation is in the duſt; and is it not worth the while to think ſeriouſly what ſhall I do to live for ever?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider what precious Wares this Veſſel is laden with. Your Veſſel is your Body, the lading your Soul, and what do you think a Soul is worth? as little as moſt mind it, if you'l believe him that bought them, he ſaith, That they are worth more than a world; and ſhall the preciouſeſt commodities be leaſt valued? or was Chriſt miſtaken, and gave too much for them? or are you wiſer than Chriſt? is gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worth more than a ſoul? are dying men, or are damned men that have loſt their ſouls, of this mind? Oh Sirs, you can never be too careful about the ſaving of your Souls.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider whither you are bound; it's for eternity, either everlaſting glory, or everlaſting miſery. Death will ſhortly land you in endleſs happineſs or ſorrow, and if you would never ſo fain you cannot then alter your ſtate; you may repent your bargain, but not mend it; prayers, tears, and wiſhes will e're long be in vain. Oh therefore ſeeing it is for eternity, do your work to purpoſe, that it may not need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of: Man your voyage is great, lay in proviſions accordingly.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:100523:8"/> 4. Conſider how few make a ſaving Voyage; many that think they are getting, when they come to caſt up their accounts, find that they were hugely out; men carry great ventures with them, and expect to be made by it, and when all comes to all they are worth leſs than nothing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever; no grace, no peace, no Chriſt, no glory; and is it worth the while to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ones life and ſoul for that which is worth nothing, and will do one no good in another world.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider what dangers you are in every moment: I need not tell you that you are ſailing within a few inches of death; ſometimes ſtorms, ſometimes ſands, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rocks, ſometimes pyrates, ſometimes a calm, and proviſions fail; ſometimes the Veſſel proves leaky, and men are fain to pump for their lives; you know your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers better than I, I wiſh you did alſo know how to ſecure your ſelves: what have you to hold up your hearts in the greateſt of difficulties? can you ſay Chriſt is my Ark in this ſtorm, his boſom will be my harbour if this ſhould prove a wrack. What doſt thou ſay man? if you can't, I wiſh you could. Awake oh ſleeper, what meaneſt thou?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Conſider how good a Voyage ſome
<pb facs="tcp:100523:8"/> make, they go out fraught with tears and groans, and paſs through many a ſtorm, devouring ſeas of difficulties, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times almoſt loſt, ſo that they ſcarce know whether they be in the Sea or out; their Maſts are ſpent, their Rigging ſpoil'd, their Anchors and Cables broke; and yet after all there hath been a calm, their Rigging recruited, and all recovered, and they come home richly laden with grace, peace, glory, and the pearl of great price, and they come top and top-gallant into the harbour of reſt, and have an abundant entrance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred into the everlaſting inheritance: and would not you be one of thoſe? Bleſſed are the people that are in ſuch a caſe; yea, bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord. Oh what a triumphant welcome will ſuch have to Glory! and would not you be glad to be of this number? but Sir, what ſhall I do to make ſuch a Voyage? If I ſhould give you advice will you take it? Oh but will you indeed? if you will not, lay down this book and read no farther: But methinks I hear ſome ſaying, Oh that we did but know what we ſhall do to be ſaved, what we ſhall do to ſecure this pearl of great price? Oh a Chriſt, a pardon and heaven, upon any terms in the world. Well then, if you take this following advice, my ſoul for yours if you miſcarry.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:100523:9"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Direction</hi> 1. Venture not out but in a <note place="margin">Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> ſound fight, and good bottom, let your ground-work be well laid, in deep hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſolid knowledg, labour to know your ſelves, your corrupt natures; your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute need of Chriſt his excellency, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for yours, and all's well. Labour to ſee ſin the greateſt evil in the world, and to loth your ſelves, and juſtifie God under a ſenſe of your own unworthineſs; beg that you may not be deceived with an hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical profeſſion, but that your hearts may be right in Gods ſtatutes; he that's ſincere is ſafe.</p>
            <p>2. Have not too many Owners, let God be your owner, and you are ſafe enough; none of his Veſſels miſcarry. Yield your ſelves to the Lord; make over all you have to him, never more your own, than when moſt his.</p>
            <p>3. Let all your tackling be of the beſt: let your Judgment be well convinced and eſtabliſhed, that's your Maſt; let your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be divine, they are your Sails; let your hope caſt Anchor upon Chriſt, and the Scripture-promiſes; let your Veſſel be well ballaſted with humility; lay in good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſuch as are ſtrengthning, wholſome, laſting, get in the whole armour of God, and reſiſt your adverſary therewith, and he will fly from you.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:100523:9"/>
            <p> 4. Let your lading &amp; fraught be ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities as will go off well in that other Country. Oh how many that are bound for another world, that are loaded with rags, dung, droſs; faith, love, meekneſs, patience, zeal, heavenly-mindedneſs; theſe, are the wares that can never want a good market.</p>
            <p>5. Make up your accounts exactly when you go out; &amp; go to the great office, &amp; inſure all whatever it coſt you; it's that may be done, you may run a ſad riskow if you don't; the comfort and peace that you will have in it wil abundantly recompence your pains &amp; charge in this buſineſs: How joyfully then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay you look dangers in the face? though the Sea run mountains high, though the waves therof roar, though every billow look as if it brought death with it; yet how comfortably may ſuch a one look, he knows that if the veſſel break, and his body be drowned, yet Chriſt lives, and he ſhal immediately be caſt upon a happy ſhore, where in amoment all wants ſhall be ſupplied, all loſſes ſhall be made up in the glorious, perfect, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fruition of God. And he that gets Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Chriſt, and Glory by his loſſes, hath no great reaſon to be afraid of them.</p>
            <p>6. Labour to make the beſt advantage of opportunity; don't loſe your markets when the wind preſents, hoiſe ſail and away: The opportunities that God gives you at Land
<pb facs="tcp:100523:10"/> in his Ordinances muſt not be ſlighted; the Lords day is your great market-day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may buy the richeſt peniworths; and when affections are ſtriving, &amp; the ſpirit of God is moving upon your ſpirits, &amp; ſtriving with your fouls, and pleading with you, then have a care of looſing ſuch an opportunity; that's a brave gale, and the wind ſits fair, &amp; if you be then ready, ſuch a wind may ſend you amain to your port; or elſe you may lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm'd, or windbound, &amp; eat out your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and loſe more than you are aware of.</p>
            <p>7. Take heed of the great rocks, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and Deſpair: take heed of the great Pyrat the Devil; take heed of running a ground: the love of the world ruins thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and if you ſtrike here it's dangerous, but if you ſtick here you are broken, Ship-wracked, loſt; take heed of all the ſins that poor Seamen are too ſubject to; Swearing, curſing, raging, damning, jeering at godlineſs neglect of prayer, hardneſs of heart, atheiſm; may I not add drunkenneſs, uncleanneſs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>8. Look oft to your Compaſs, the Word of God, and then you can't ſteer amiſs; read and meditate upon the Scriptures, the Bible is an excellent companion.</p>
            <p>9. Get a good Convoy, Pilot, Factor, Chriſt is all; count all as dung and droſs in compariſon of him: let your eye be ſtill to him, your heart upon him, and know this,
<pb facs="tcp:100523:10"/> you can't overvalue him whom never yet any did ſufficiently prize; let your hearts be much above, let not ſea and land make you forget heaven, think you never make agood port till you are ſafe in the arms of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>10. Keep an exact Journal, obſerve what way you make, by this God may have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; you may have paſt experiences to feed your faith, and hope upon for the future. O that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
            <p>11. Let loſſes make you more diligent to get and ſecure that which can't be loſt.</p>
            <p>12. In a word take heed of a ſleepy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different careleſs ſpirit; take heed of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a <hi>Jonah</hi> aboard, of carrying any ſin unrepented out with you; and be much earneſt and conſtant in prayer.</p>
            <p>But in this and many other things, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to this ſeaſonable and excellent Diſcourſe which is calculated for the tribe of <hi>Zebulon</hi> chiefly. Again, I ſay, read and think, and read and practiſe, read and pray; and this will be the joy of one that dearly loves you, and daily prayeth for you,</p>

            <p>YOur ſtate and calling is ſet forth by the Spirit of God, to be the moſt dangerous of all Means; You mount up to Heaven, and go down again to the depths, and is not this a deſperate caſe? <hi>Their ſoul is melted becauſe of trouble,</hi> (can any more <note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 26, 27.</note> be ſaid in a word, to declare their forlorn and deplorable condition?) <hi>They reel to and fro like a drunken man, and are at their wits end.</hi> They know not what to do, but then their eyes are up to God: And that when you are plunged into this ſad eſtate, you may have ſome good Anchor-hold for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is the deſign of theſe Papers, ſent now into your hands. 1. Love to your Souls ſtudied them; love to your Souls
<pb facs="tcp:100523:11"/> preached them, and now love to your Souls, (notwithſtanding the many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections they are clothed withal,) prints them; and indeed they were haſtned to the Preſs, rather by the voice of God than man: Thoughts of preſenting them to publick view were taken up, and laid down again ſome Months, but that dreadful ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum from Heaven, in that fatal ſtorm, both at Sea and Land, when ſo many Ships and Lives miſcarryed; <hi>viz. September</hi> the 11. and 12, 1671. did occaſion the reaſſuming freſh thoughts, that through the bleſſing of God, they might be uſeful to the good of poor Seamen; and ſo the Author was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to truſt God with them; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſo few Treatiſes being in print, for the ſakes of poor Seamen, that live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly lives of death and danger, and their Relations, that lives Lives of ſorrow and fear: That you may be ſerious in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and practiſing what now is put into your hand; Let me tell you,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Your Souls, your Families, your Eſtates, your Lives; nay, your All is here concerned: The deſign of theſe Papers is the Enſurance of your immortal precious Souls, this is the Jewel if ſafe, all is ſafe, if this be loſt, all is loſt, Ships loſt, you may get others; nay, the loſs of Relations may be made up, but the loſs of a Soul is an
<pb facs="tcp:100523:12"/> irreparable loſs; as it is unvaluable, ſo it is irreparable, it can neither be made up, nor ſum'd up. O poor Seamen what a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious commodity do you carry to Sea with you! what an unvaluable Jewel! and yet run the venture, take no care to enſure this, that is infinitely worth more than all you carry to Sea with you beſides?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your ſnares and temptations are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other mens: May it not be ſaid of you, as of them, <hi>Fear, the Pit, and the ſnare are upon you:</hi> It is to be hoped you are not all fearleſs and graceleſs. Snares of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies at land, at ſea, at home, and abroad; ſnares of foreign Countries, and ſnares of your callings: Oh what a wonder it is that poor Seamen that walk upon ſnares, are no more ſenſible of them! that they are not like him that dreamed he ſaw the world full of ſnares, and heard a voice ſay, <hi>Quis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſeat iſta?)</hi> Who ſhall paſs through theſe? and afterwards he heard a voice ſay by way of reply, <hi>Humilitas pertranſit,</hi> Humility ſhall paſs through. So ſay I, Oh poor Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, a watchful heart ſhall paſs through all your ſnares, you have need of as many eyes as the Poets feign <hi>Argus</hi> to have. Who have ſo many ſnares as you have! How true is that of many Seamen that <hi>Job</hi> hath of the wicked, <hi>For he is caſt into a net by his own feet,</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:100523:12"/> 3. Your opportunities and ſeaſons for your Souls are fewer than other mens. Good Books muſt be your Sermons, and if you will not read when you cannot hear, you live in a daily neglect of your duty to God, and to your own precious ſouls; Oh how ſad would it be, and will it be for you one day, if you ſleight and deſpiſe the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, when you are at home! where you may enjoy it as in no place of the world whither you go; and when you are at Sea neglect thoſe advantages, which you may have in reading of the word; Seamens Ordinances are and ought to be Gods Providences; and their Miniſtry, and Preachers, Seas and Winds, if you ſleight the Miniſtry of your <hi>Barnabaſſes</hi> aſhore, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sons of Conſolation, you ſhall meet with the Miniſtry of <hi>Boarnergeſſes</hi> at Sea, a Miniſtry of Thunder: Doth not God often thunder upon you in ſtorms, Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes, and mighty Tempeſts? doth not the Lord make that word good upon many poor Seamen? <hi>

            <p n="4">4. Your Accounts are great: No men have greater accounts to give to God than Seamen have; therefore they had need look well to the ſtating of them; poor Seamen, though you put it off, yet the great Audit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day

As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays to the young man, ſo I ſay to the Seamen, <hi>Rejoyce O poor profane Seaman in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes; But know thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee into judgment.</hi> 1. O that Seamen would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Lord will call them to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their vows, that their lips have uttered in the day of their diſtreſs: The day will come that they ſhall ſay, <hi>Thy vows are</hi>

Can you make vows, and break them with the ſame breach? 2. Oh that Seamen would conſider God will call them to an account for the Convictions they have had in their ſtorms and diſtreſſes: Oh doth not God and Conſcience often board them (as I may ſay) and come to cloſe fight with them, and tell them, poor ſinners, theſe are your ſins, your crying ſins, that you muſt leave and lay aſide, if ever you
<pb facs="tcp:100523:13"/> expect to find mercy from me, and theſe are your duties that you muſt conſcientiouſly take up, as ever you think to have my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable preſence with you. Oh now how ordinary is it for poor Seamen to wear off and looſe ſuch Convictions? but though you forget them, God remembers them, and will call you to an account for them. 3. God will call you to an account for your Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Preſervations; are there any men in the world men of ſo many deliverances and mercies as Seamen are? Oh what deaths and dangers do they paſs through every Voyage! how may it be ſaid to many of them, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did to <hi>David? As I live there is but a ſtep betwixt thee and death:</hi> What few ſteps, inches, are betwixt Seamen and death, nay, and damnation, if they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry before an intereſt gotten in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? and can you think, nay dare you think that God gives you ſuch mercies and preſervations to ſpend them upon your luſts; to gratifie your fleſh withal? may not you hear God ſometimes ſaying to you as in that caſe, <hi>Are you delivered to do all theſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 1.</note> 
               <hi>abominations?</hi> Oh will not God ſay to you, Did not I give thee thy life poor ſinner, when many others miſcarryed? did not I bring thee off in a moſt miraculous manner, when others were ſwallowed up? and what uſe didſt thou make of ſuch a preſervation?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:100523:14"/> 4. God will call Seamen to an account for all their Provocations: Oh poor Souls, you no ſooner commit them, but you forget them; Oh but God hath a book of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in which they are all recorded, and out of which you ſhall be judged; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of all hearts in that day ſhall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; all the hidden things of darkneſs ſhall be brought to light, all ſecret guilt at home or abroad in the foreign parts of the Earth; all your ſecret ſins are ſet in the light of Gods countenance. 5. God will call Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to an account, for their Afflictions: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them they meet with great trials, one while breaches upon their Eſtates comes upon them, as the breaches of the Sea; one Voyage it may be rich, and the next impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, or if not ſo, it may be taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi> or ſome cruel Enemies, and then under great ſlavery and miſery, and after all redeemed; Oh will not God call to an account for this. What better were you for your ſlavery? did it make you ſenſible of your ſpiritual captivity? did it bring you out of Soul-bondage? did it occaſion you to conſider this ſlavery of your bodies to the <hi>Turks,</hi> is nothing to the ſlavery of your ſouls to ſin and Satan? As it is ſaid by God, <hi>I ſent you into the Land of Chaldea for your good;</hi> ſo will God ſay, I ſent you into <hi>Sally,</hi> I ſent you into <hi>Argier,</hi> but was it for your

Oh what a pity it is to ſee bodies of poor Seamen redeemed, and their ſouls Captives ſtill! to ſee them Drunkards, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, unclean, and what not, after they have been ſlaves. Oh what pity it is to hear them talk of their ſlavery, and ſee their ſouls lie ſtill in irons and fetters; Captives to the Prince of darkneſs, which is worſe bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage than that you talk on, when men are ſent up into the Country to the King of <hi>Feſs?</hi> 6. God will call Seamen for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their time; they have abundance of time, many of them, and God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with them for it, what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they made of it, what uſe they put it to? It is a talent, the improvement of it is accountable.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Poor Seamen to move you to read and practiſe, what you here meet with; conſider your day goeth away; your glaſs runs apace, you are ſailing for Eternity; you being under ſail for another world, why ſhould not your eyes and hearts be much upon that Country, to which you are bound? Doſt thou know whether thou ſhalt make this Voyage that thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on? Canſt thou aſſure thy ſelf of a ſafe arrival, or a ſafe return? Canſt thou ſay as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, when he went to offer up his Son, <hi>I, and the lad will go yonder to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and we will return?</hi> Can you promiſe
<pb facs="tcp:100523:15"/> your dear Relations a meeting again in this world, when you part with them? and ſhould not you then be ſerious in reading, in practiſing, in improving any thing that concerns the peace of your precious ſouls?</p>
            <p n="6">6. That poor Seamen may read and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: Oh that they would conſider how loſt time will ſting their poor ſouls another day! have not many of you much time for reading, prayer, heart-examination? though it is true, ſuch are your circumſtances ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that your time will not give you leave for ſuch ſerious employments; yet again at other times, you have abundance of leiſure, is not this a great ſin among Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, idly to game their time away, or to talk it away, or ſinfully to ſport it away? but when you come into a ſtorm at Sea, or upon a death-bed at land, what will your ſouls ſay to it then? Oh that I had redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med my time! Oh that I had been more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to make my calling and election ſure! Oh that I had ſpent more time in reading, prayer, heart-examination, than I have done! and leſs in ſinful pleaſures in ſinful company, in ſinful conference. It was a ſad ſaying of a diſtreſſed ſoul, when go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to die, <hi>Ten pounds for an hour: Ten pounds for an hour.</hi> Oh poor ſoul what wouldſt thou not give for a day, or two, reprieve from hell and death, if there might be hope of a pardon.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb facs="tcp:100523:15"/> 7. That poor Seamen may read and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, Oh that they would conſider, they have as great need for grace, as any men under heaven have. Oh what need have Seamen, and their poor Relations of grace; as in that caſe is ſaid by the Apoſtle, <hi>You have need of Patience.</hi> So I may ſay in this, Oh poor Seamen, you have need of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to bear your ſtorms quietly; and Oh how many that do not poſſeſs their Souls in patience, in tempeſts and ſtorms; but are in as great a ſtorm as the Sea it ſelf, whoſe hearts are like the troubled Sea, that caſt forth nothing but mire and dirt, who belch out their Oaths &amp; Blaſphemies againſt God; and like that King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> ſin more and more in the time of their diſtreſs; who are like a Bull, a wild Bull in the net, full of the fury of the Lord. If the winds blow they ſwear. What need have you of faith for your Souls, for your Bodies, for your Relations? Is not faith a ſtorm-grace, and may not Jeſus Chriſt ſay to many why are you fearful? Oh you of little faith; nay, why are you ſo bold and preſumptuous, Oh you of no faith!</p>
            <p n="8">8. That poor Seamen may read and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: Oh that they would conſider, their account will be aggravated by what they meet with here if they practiſe it not; as Chriſt ſaid to thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo may I ſay in
<pb facs="tcp:100523:16"/> this caſe, <hi>If I had not comne, and ſpoken unto you, you had not had ſin, but now your ſin remains:</hi> viz.

Wil't not be ſaid another day, were you not warned of ſuch a danger? of ſuch a ſin? charged by the Lord in the Miniſtry of the Word, to ſubmit and ſubject your ſouls to ſuch a duty; and will not all this be matter of evidence againſt you in the great day? But that your poor Souls may be pull'd as brands out of the burning, and come in this your day to hearken to the voice of the Lord, and not harden your hearts as in the day of Provocation; but know the things that concerns the peace of your precious Soul, before they be hid from your eyes; is the earneſt prayer of him who is one that deſires nothing more than to be directed to let down the Net at the right ſide of the Ship, that your poor Souls may be brought into Chriſt by it.</p>

            <p>In this chapter we have, 1. <hi>Jonahs</hi> diſobedience to Gods Call, (from the firſt Verſe to the fourth:) <hi>2ly.</hi> The Lords puniſhing <hi>Jonahs</hi> diſobedience, (from the fourth verſe to the <hi>17th.) 3ly.

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> we have his Commiſſion in the firſt Verſe, To go and cry againſt the great City; Ariſe, <hi>go to Nineveh, that great City, and cry againſt it, for their wickedneſs is come up before me.</hi> This City was the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Aſsyria,</hi> and had its name from <hi>Ninus,</hi> ſome think <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 11.</note> built at firſt by <hi>Nimrod;</hi> from that place, and out of that land went forth <hi>Aſſur,</hi> and builded <hi>Nineveh,</hi> (which ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors read) out of this land he, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Nimrod,</hi> went forth to <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and

            <p>Obſerve, The greatneſs of Cities, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not priviledg them from the blows of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wrath. What though it be a great City? God is a great God, and the great God ſends Summons to the great City, and ſends by <hi>Jonah</hi> as his Herauld at Armes, to prepare to meet the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> obſerve, Great Cities have their great Sins. <hi>For their wickedneſs is come up before me:</hi> What the ſin of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh</hi> was, is not yet expreſt; ſome think Sodomy, ſome Sorcery, an ordinary ſin in thoſe parts. But <hi>Nahum</hi> more clearly tells us what it was, it is called <hi>the bloody City, full of Lies and Roberies, and the prey departed not.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> obſerve, Great ſins bring great Judgments, great was the diſpleaſure of God againſt <hi>Nineveh,</hi> that he ſends the Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> to denounce his Wrath againſt them.

            <p>Various thoughts Expoſitors have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: 1. Some think fear of cruel u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, the <hi>Ninevites</hi> being a ſavage bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people. <hi>2ly.</hi> He might deſpair that <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhould obey his Meſſage, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had not, amongſt whom he had Prophecyed with little ſucceſs; he might ſay to God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did: Lord, if <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>

So if <hi>Iſrael</hi> will not hear me, how ſhould <hi>Nineveh? 3ly.</hi> Others put it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his love to his own Countrey, for in the ſending to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> he might probably foreſee the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> might be the Rejection of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and upon this might fall under a Temptation. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Others put it upon that diſguſt, his own Countreymen would take at it, who had ſuch an emulation againſt the <hi>Gentiles. 5ly.</hi> Others (and I humbly conceive with very good reaſons) put it upon his pride of ſpirit, fearing leſt he ſhould not

            <p>3. In the 4 Verſe we have Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure in <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Puniſhment, but the Lord ſent a great wind into the Sea. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the Lord is ſole Commander at Sea, the winds do not riſe accidentally, but they have their Commiſſion from God; though <hi>Jonah</hi> would not obey Gods Commiſſion, yet the winds do. Here the Lord ſends a Purſevant in a ſtorme, after a rebellious Prophet, the Winds and the Sea are God's ſervants. O let Sea-men trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at this! God can cauſe theſe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to execute his will upon them when he pleaſeth; it is greatly the ſin of ſuch Perſons, that they look not higher then natural cauſes; but alas, every ſtorm ſhould read a Lecture to you of God, when you are at Sea.</p>
            <p>We may further obſerve, guilt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flee from God; God ſends after guilt; guilt carried to Sea, will have a ſtorm ſent after it: O tremble poor Sea-men, when you go out to carry unpardoned guilt abroad with you.</p>
            <p>Again obſerve, Perſons employed, and eſpecially commiſſioned by God, may in their Temptations go croſs to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100523:19"/> thus did <hi>Jonah</hi> here, thus did <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.</note> the young Prophet, who bare that brave Teſtimony againſt the Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> yet he failed afterwards, and went croſs to his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Now the Text it ſelf contains in it a diſcovery of the effects, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of this ſtorm God ſends after <hi>Jonah.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Here is a deſcription of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under theſe Effects.</item>
               <item>2. The Effects themſelves.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. The Perſons. <hi>Then the Marriners were afraid.</hi> They are the moſt undaunted of Men, the hardieſt of Men, being ſo frequently in theſe deaths and dangers: they little regard them, and yet theſe perſons are afraid; not the Paſſengers were affraid, but the Marriners, that uſed to encourage the poor trembling Paſſengers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have the Effects themſelves, <hi>In fear.</hi> They were afraid, though they had been probably in many ſtormes before, yet here being ſome things extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Caſe to be diſcovered, this fear fell upon them. Now their courage and magnanimity were daunted, this ſtorm made them lower their Top-ſails of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and confidence. 2. Effect of this ſtorm was, <hi>every one cryed to his God;</hi> which argues the greatneſs of their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100523:20"/> fears; it puts them upon ſeriouſneſs; ſtormes will change Mariners notes, turn their Swearing into Praying; it may be Swearing by their Gods was their practice before, but now Praying is their practice. They cryed, which notes the earneſtneſs <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 38.</note> of their Spirits; as Perſons in diſtreſs cry to the true God, ſo they cryed to their falſe God. 3. Effect, and caſt out the Wares to lighten it, which ſtill ſpoke their fears; this is one of the laſt things you doe at Sea, to ſave your lives; <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo with the Ship he was in, caſt the Wheat over-board: here are all endeavours uſed to prevent Ship-wrack.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thing in the Text, is a deſcription of the guilty Perſon. 1. <hi>Jonah</hi> was in the ſides of the Ship: <hi>Jonah,</hi> whom the Mariners leaſt ſuſpected, for they caſt lotts, we ſee, to know who it was; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected Perſon is often the guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>2. We have an account of his poſture, he was gone into the ſides of the Ship, and was faſt aſleep. Was he praying? no, though that would have been more proper, more comely work a great deal for a guilty Perſon. What a ſtrange ſight is here in the Ship? <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> praying? And a Prophet, yea a guilty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100523:20"/> Prophet, ſleeping? nay, obſerve the word, <hi>faſt aſleep.</hi> O what a Potion had he taken, that he could be ſleeping, and the Veſſel ſinking; neither the Windes roaring, nor the Ships beating, nor the Mariners pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor the Ships lightning; none of theſe awakens <hi>Jonah.</hi> O what a ſound ſleep was he in!</p>
            <p>The firſt Obſervation is this, that ſtormes of danger, cauſes ſtormes of fear; <hi>the Marriners were afraid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will begin to handle this, as being that part of my work, intended for the awakening of the Souls of poor Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>Theſe Marriners, were poor blind Heathens, as you ſee by praying to their Gods; and they were afraid: now if the glimmering of the light of Nature did make them afraid, O then well may poor ſinners be afraid, that have the light of the Goſpel ſhineing into their hearts, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, when they come into ſtormes; if Heathens who had no light, nor ſight of a future ſtate, of their immortal Souls, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Death was terrible to them, (as it doth untie the Marriage knot between the Soul and Body) were afraid, then how may Sinners, that know, if they ſuffer Ship-wrack in a ſtorm, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100523:21"/> in Chriſt, they periſh Body and Soul to all Eternity; (well I ſay may ſuch Souls be afraid in ſtormes.) You ſee what thoſe Marriners ſay, <hi>if peradventure that we periſh not.</hi> They only meant of the periſhing of the out-ward man, what then may ſuch Souls ſay, that know they are not intereſted in Chriſt, and yet muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably periſh in their ſtormes? To be ſinking at Sea, and have no bottom, for thy poor Soul to build its hopes upon, when thou ſhalt lanch out into that vaſt Ocean of Eternity, it will daunt and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze the ſtouteſt Marriner, and ſinner in the world; the Diſciples, we read of them ſometimes in their ſtormes, and in their fears, they ſometimes cry out, <hi>why careſt thou not that we periſh?</hi> well then may Prophane Sinners cry out in their ſtormes and dangers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe Death is before men in ſtormes, therefore they are in fears; thus it was with thoſe in my Text, they ſee nothing but death before them. O when poor Sea-men get a ſight of the King of terrours in ſtormes, O how doth their countenances fall! how are their notes changed? If many poor Souls be afraid of death, are kept in bondage through the fear of death, all their life long, and yet
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100523:21"/> Chriſt came to deliver them from death; well may poor Sinners then be afraid of death; O what ſad cryes have many Souls uttered under the Fears and Horror of Death; one cryes, O that I might live <note place="margin">

               <p>Is it ſo, that dangers at Sea, uſually bring fears with them; hence note our natural ſecurity and ſtupidity: that untill dangers come we are not afraid: they were ſecure till the ſtorme came, as the old World was until the flood came: many poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and poor Seamen, are not afraid of Death, or Hell, untill they be at the door; they put the evil day farre from them, they ſay they have made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Hell and Death; The over-flowing ſcourge ſhall not come nigh them. Thus many never think what will become of their Souls, until they be ready to ſink at Sea, or until they lie upon a death-bed;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100523:24"/> and is not this dreadful ſtupidity, to neglect doing that which muſt be done, or their Souls are undone for ever?</p>
               <p>2. If dangers uſually be attended with fear, then it informs us, what a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the People of God are in, who are reconciled to God, to whom God hath ſaid, <hi>As for you, it ſhall go well with you: ſay</hi>

               <p>3. It informes us of the miſery of poor Souls out of Chriſt, eſpecially in their times of danger: O how are the poor ſouls grinded with fears! all fear hath torment in it. How doth the fears of Death and Hell walk in their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in their ſtormes; and torment, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bondage them! If Beleivers may be kept in bondage, through the fears of Death, <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100523:24"/> what bondage then are poor Chriſt-leſs Souls in, when awakened by dangers? In dangers, ſuch Souls have no God to go to, in their ſtorms they have no refuge, in the over-flowing ſcourge, they have no hiding place, in a ſcattering day, they have no reſting place, to retire their poor Souls unto; they are in dangers without hope yea without heart; their hearts ſink in them, like Lead in the mighty waters: alas poor Sea-men, if your Souls be out of Chriſt, your Souls will be ſunk before your Veſſels, when ſtorms are upon you. <hi>Alexander</hi> uſed to ſay of any great danger, Here is a danger fit for the mind of an <hi>Alexander</hi> to grapple withall, but a poor Chriſt-leſs Soul is fit to grapple with no danger.</p>
               <p>4. It inform's us then, It is not mens own ſpirits and courage that keeps their Soules above fear in times of danger. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners in my Text were afraid; had it been the Paſſengers, it had not been ſo much to be wondered at; but the Marriners that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally have ſuch bold ſpirits, that they are even hardned, becauſe ſentence is not ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily executed; who are ſo accuſtomed to ſtorms, that they regard them not: yet theſe are afraid. O now the ſtorm was gotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, and its the ſtorm gotten within the Man, that ſinks him, which made <hi>David</hi> cry <note place="margin">

                  <hi>thee.</hi> When you are in the remote ends of the Earth, O then to cry to the Lord is a great Priviledg. Thus <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>when my</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100523:25"/> 
                  <hi>heart is over-whelmed, lead me to the Rock that is higher than I:</hi> a Metaphor taken from Ship-wrack't Men, (ſay ſome Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) or thoſe that are ready to be ſunk: when they ſee ſome Creek or Rocks to put into, they get upon the Rock, and are ſet above the Storm. O poor Sea-men, you may be above both Dangers and Storms. If your ſeet bee upon this Rock, you may here reſt like the Ark when the Deluge was abroad. The Text tells, it reſted upon Mount <hi>Ararat,</hi> (which one obſerves, ſignifies) <hi>Take-away-fear.</hi> O! Jeſus Chriſt is the Mount <hi>Ararat,</hi> for poor Souls to reſt on in all Storms and Dangers. O it is ſad to be a <hi>Magor-miſſabib</hi> at Land! a Terrour to ones ſelf, and to all round about you; O what a ſad thing is it to be ſo at Sea!</p>
               <p>Take a few Directions. If you would be above fears in times of danger at Sea; then carry Chriſt in the Veſſel, (I mean) be you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in Chriſt; nothing will put a Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fear, ſo much as a ſight, and diſcovery of Intereſt. When <hi>David</hi> was in danger at Land, and <hi>the People ſpake of ſtoning him,</hi> what <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6.</note> courſe took he to be above fears? he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged himſelf in the Lord his God. We read of a ſtorm at Sea, and yet Chriſt was aboard, but the cryes of the periſhing Diſciples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened him, and he ſaid to the ſtorm, <hi>Peace, and be ſtill. Caeſar</hi> when once going a Voyage by Sea in a ſtorm, the Marriners being afraid,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100523:26"/> he cryes out to them, fear not, you carry <hi>Caeſar:</hi> but it may be ſaid, A greater than <hi>Caeſar</hi> is here, fear not, you carry Chriſt; O for ſuch a ſight in Sea-dangers, as <hi>Paul</hi> had in his Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Angel of the Lord cryed unto him, <hi>Fear not,</hi> Paul, <hi>God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>hath given thee all them that ſail with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If you would be above fears in ſtorms, then commit the Helm to Chriſt as Pilot, <hi>viz.</hi> Commit all to him by prayer, every Man here in the Text, cryed unto the Lord his God<hi>:</hi> Let him in all dangers ſteer your Courſe for you, commit your way to the Lord. The ſtory is famous of a Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and a good Biſhop in <hi>Germany,</hi> who were at enmity; and the Duke ſent to ſee what preparations the Biſhop made; the Meſſengers returned and gave the Duke this account: He made no preparations, but what ſayes he then? he replyes, ſay the Meſſengers, he would preach the Goſpel, he would viſit the Sick, and be found in his Duty. And as for the War, he would, <hi>(Totius Belli molem Deo committere)</hi> for the bulk of the War, he would commit it to God. O then ſayes the Duke, if he be of that mind, let the Devil wage War againſt him, if he will: for I will not. So, if you commit the Helm of all your affairs and buſineſſes to Jeſus Chriſt, by Faith and Prayer, this would help you to be above fears.</p>

               <p> 3. Would ye be above ſtorms and fears at Sea? O then carry not <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Veſſel, <hi>(viz.)</hi> guilt with you, guilt will raiſe a ſtorm, ſooner or later: you ſee here that the Sea was never quiet, until <hi>Jonah</hi> was caſt over-board, then it calm'd. O let your guilt be thrown into the Sea of Chriſts blood, then all will be calm and quiet within; we ſee in the Text it was not lightning the Ship of the goods, that did ſtill the ſtorm, while <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was there, who was the guilty Perſon: unpardoned guilt is the black water, you muſt pump out by Repentance; one <hi>Achan</hi> ſpoils a whole Camp, and here one <hi>Jonah</hi> brought a ſtorm upon the whole Ships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; it was a Notable ſaying of one of the Wiſe-men of <hi>Greece,</hi> being aboard in a Veſſel, who heard ſome wicked Marriners upon a time praying to their Gods, he called to them to be ſilent, for if their Gods knew they were there, they would drown them all for their ſakes.

               <p>For the underſtanding of which, we muſt conceive, Man at his Creation, was created <hi>in the Image of God,</hi> which conſiſted in <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi>

                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24</note> and <hi>true Holineſs;</hi> now the beams of light, that ſhone round about him, and upon his <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi>'s Phraſe is) theſe were eclipſed, and darkned, by his fall; but not ſo totally extinguiſhed, as to be clean put out; the eye of Natural light was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put out, ſome glimmerings and remains are ſtill, in loſt man, though not ſo ſtrong as to lead him to Chriſt, (which ſome vainly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100523:28"/> contend for;) yet ſo ſtrong, as many times, it is at work upon Natural Conſcience, to accuſe or excuſe; So we read of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though they were without a Law promulged, as the <hi>Jews</hi> had, yet not without a Law <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15,</note> engrafted in their Conſciences: whereby they had common Dictates, about Good and Evil; which light was a Law to them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things. So that the light of Nature, is the ſtrength and Law of Natural Conſcience; ſtirring in a poor Creature that's ignorant of God in Chriſt: It is called <hi>the Candle of the</hi>

                  <hi>Lord,</hi> Searching <hi>the dark places of the Belly,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> I conceive, meant of this, when he <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14.</note> ſaid, <hi>Doth not even Nature teach thee?</hi> (viz.) the light of Nature.</p>
               <p>This light of Nature in times of danger, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 5.</note> did teach the very Heathens to look up to their Gods: we read in the Prophet, that God threatned <hi>to caſt down their ſlain before their Idols,</hi> they uſed in times of danger, to ſtand before their Idols, to enquire of them; O now ſayes God, they who have ſtood before them, to worſhip them, ſhall be caſt down before them. I find one, upon this Text <hi>[They cryed unto their Gods, every one to his God.]</hi> He gives a Reaſon, the uncertainty that attends Idolatry, diſtruſting <hi>their Gods,</hi> to be the true God, and ſo called on <hi>Jonah</hi> to pray to <hi>his God;</hi> therefore they uſed to cloſe their ſuperſtitious Devotions with that General.

                  <hi>(Dii, Deaeque omnes.)</hi> Going to enquire of Oracles, Heatheniſh Hiſtory is full of; they would not attempt any great deſign, but firſt inquired of their Idolatrous Oracles, which is very teaching to Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Natural Conſcience acknowledges a God in times of Danger.</hi> For though the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens knew not God; yet they acknowledged, by their falſe Gods, their many Deities, that there was a God, though ſome worſhipped <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi>

                     <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</note> the true God. We read of the Horſes of the Sun, which ſome underſtand were Horſes, upon which men rode early in the morning to worſhip the Sun, upon its riſing: others think, they were only Pictures of Horſes of the Sun: <note place="margin">

Alſo we read of the Inſcription of the Men of <hi>Athens, To the unknown God.</hi> Therefore it is ſaid, when any Perſons in what Countryes ſoever, are ſurprized with danger; in their Native Dialect they uſe this Expreſſion, which we do in <hi>England, O God!</hi> Well, this is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100523:29"/> acknowleeged by theſe Heathens, in a ſtorm. <hi>They cried unto their Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Natural Conſcience doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that this God is able to deliver in time of danger, or elſe why do they cry to him?</hi> Therefore the Heathens offered Sacrifices, to appeaſe their Gods, when they conceived they were Angry; and had ſtately Temples built for this very end. That was a ſharp return of God's, <hi>Go to the gods which you have ſerved, and ſee if they can deliver you;</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had in ſuch Caſes high apprehenſions, and high expectations from their gods: ſome think the Reaſon of that Inſcription at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, To the unknown God,</hi> was to conceal the Name of the Tutelary God, unto whoſe protection they had committed themſelves; for they conceived, if their god's Name was known, the Enemies of the City might <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thus the</hi> Tyrians, <hi>and</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note> charm him away: therefore they ſettered their Gods, and chained them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Natural Conſcience acknowledges, that, God in order to deliverance, is to be ſought unto;</hi> they cryed: in the Text, <hi>unto their Gods,</hi> they do not neglect the uſe of means, and hope for deliverance without endeavours; this is irrational; Natural light teaches ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Leſſon, they do not only <hi>lighten the Ship,</hi> but they alſo <hi>cry to their Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Natural Conſcience acknowledges this alſo,</hi> that this God muſt be under Profeſſion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100523:30"/> and Adoration, <hi>Every man cryed to his God,</hi> the God he worſhiped and ſerved; and ſo that word in the Prophet, <hi>Every one walking in</hi>

                     <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the Name of his God.</hi> Is it not ſaid of the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> that they offer Sacrifice to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and ſay There is a good God; and he will not hurt them: therefore they need not ſerve him: but, there is a bad God, meaning the Devil, and he will torment them, if he be not ſacrificed unto; the very light of Nature, teaches a kind of worſhip in time of danger.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reaſon, Why the light of Nature puts upon Prayer in times of danger; is, becauſe it looks at ſelf-preſervation, all Natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are for ſelf-preſervation; therefore ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions to ſelf-murder are unnatural, and more immediately from <hi>Satan,</hi> the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Man-kind; every Creature will avoid its own Death and Diſſolution: and, Shall we do this by the light of Nature for our Bodies? and do nothing for our Souls? ſhall Creatures that have not Reaſon avoid Death? and ſhall not poor Sinners that have the light of the Goſpel ſhining round about them, avoid Eternal Death and Damnation?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe, in times of danger the light of Nature carries convictions along with it, of a Deity, and a Deity uſed to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up unto in time of danger; therefore in judgements upon Nations, they uſed to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to their Gods. Theſe Heathen Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100523:30"/> in the Text, now have convictions of ſome Supream Being, that could quiet their ſtorms, whether they worſhiped the Sun, Moon or Stars, which is probable they did, being proper for their own calling. Theſe probably might be the Mariners Gods; having ſuch an influence upon the Sea. We read of the Moon called <hi>the Queen of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 19.</note> and the Hoſts Moon and Starrs, theſe being conſiderable in Navigation; the poor Heathen might eaſily be drawn in to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg them for Deities, and ſo in their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, might look up to them for relief. All holds out a conviction of a Deity in time of danger: it is not what men thinks in ſuch an Atheiſtical Age as this, when they ſwim in all manner of Earthly delights, when they drown their very Reaſon in the Sea of their ſinful pleaſures; but when they come into dangers, when death is ſet before them, when they came into affliction, what ſays Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them then? Is there not a God then? have they not immortal Souls then? is there not an Eternity then?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe Conſcience-ſtorms are quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this means. A ſtorm of Conſcience, and a ſtorm at Sea when they meet, will make terrible work. So that ſome thing muſt be done to quiet Conſcience: ſo that duties at Sea and Land, are but made a ſleepy Sop to allay the rage of an awaken'd barking Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100523:31"/> 4. Becauſe the light of Nature is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting light, it can look back to ſin and guilt, and Perſons are never ſo much upon prayer, as when they are upon reflex Acts; and Perſons are never ſo much upon reflex Acts, as when brought into dangers. This Reflexion, we read of it to be the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character of men, to diſtinguiſh betwixt Them and Brutes, <hi>Bring it again to mind, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 46. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>know that you are men, O you Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</hi> Now Natural Conſcience reflecting upon its own actings, finding guilt upon ſearch; then it puts upon Prayer.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, It is a word of Reproof. If the light of Nature in times of danger will put men upon Prayer; then it reproves Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Curſing and Swearing in times of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a ſin too ordinary among Sea-men. O poor Mariners, theſe Heathens will riſe up in judgment againſt you another day! that you that have known ſo much of the true God, heard ſo much of him, and yet you act ſo much below them: Are not you at ſuch times more like Heathens, and they more like Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſin againſt greater light, you ſin under Sun light, they ſin but under Star-light<hi>:</hi> it may be ſaid in this Caſe, as was ſaid by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100523:31"/> Chriſt, to the <hi>Phariſees, If I had not come, and ſpoken unto you, you had not had ſin, but now your ſin remains;</hi> and the more light you ſin againſt, the more is your ſin aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You are to be Reproved: you ſin in time of Danger, and this is to ſin daringly, in a preſumptuous way; to ſin when God is threatning to ſtrike; this is impudent ſinning, for the child to ſin while the Father hath the Rod in his hand; this highly aggravates the Offence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such are to be Reproved; for this is to ſin, by being deaf to a voice of the Lord; it is ſinning againſt a Call of God's. God now calls for Prayer, <hi>They cryed to him in their diſtreſs, is any man afflicted, let him pray,</hi> now is a time for Prayer. O how ſad is this, when you ſhould be calling on the Name of God, then to be blaſpheming of the Name of God!</p>
               <p n="4">4. Are not ſuch to be reproved, who ſin in the face of Death? it may be, Swearing and Sinking? is it not better to ſink Praying than Swearing? O ſad to dye with Oaths and Blaſphemy in your Mouths! ſin in your Lives, and ſin in your Deaths too; Can you look the King of Terrour in the face, with curſed Oaths againſt God in your mouthes? O let not that Proverb be turned! its uſed to be ſaid, <hi>If you will teach a man to</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100523:32"/> 
                  <hi>pray, ſend him to Sea.</hi> O let it not be turned, <hi>if you would teach a man to Swear, ſend him to Sea; if you would teach a man to Curſe, to be Prophane, ſend him to Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Are not ſuch to be reproved, who have had ſo many Salvations, and Deliverances, and ſin after all theſe? as <hi>Ezra</hi> ſaid, ſo ſhould <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſra</hi> 9. 13.</note> poor Seamen ſay, <hi>What after ſuch delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as this, ſhall we break again thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments?</hi> all your Deliverances will one day add to your Condemnation, your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at Sea from ſinking, will but ſink you; ſo much the deeper in Hell, if the Lord be not merciful to you.</p>
               <p>2. Uſe: Is it ſo, that the light of Nature puts upon Prayer in time of danger. Then it is an Uſe of Exhortation, to all Maſters of Ships eſpecially, to ſet up Prayer: the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Ship, came unto the Prophet, and ſaid, <hi>ariſe ſleeper, and pray to thy God,</hi> &amp;c. Why was <hi>Jonah</hi> a Servant? how was the Maſter concerned with <hi>Jonah?</hi> he was a Paſſenger; yet he now ſees in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that all aboard were upon their duty; you will have your times of Watch kept up, and why not times of Prayer? Here is a Pattern for yea Sea-Commanders, to call upon your ſleepy Companies to pray.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You are in deaths often, and ſhould not ſuch be in duty often? what not in prayers
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100523:32"/> often. Men will never pray, if not in danger: may not you hear the Winds and the Seas, ſaying often to you, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David, As I live, there is but a ſtep betwixt thee, and death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You are under more Temptations, than many others. What in the midſt of Temptations and not pray? Little does your Relations know (it may be) what Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you meet with, in the remote parts of the Earth; O but God and your Conſciences know, The Temptations of Countries, are ſad Temptations: eſpecially when they meet with ſuitable matter in conſtitutions, when a Country-temptation, and a mans Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on meet together; O how ſad is this! It is ſaid of <hi>Iſrael, they mingled with the Heathen,</hi>

Of all men in the World, The vowes of God are upon Sea-men; and will not you pay the vowes, your Souls have uttered to the Lord in the dayes of your diſtreſs? <hi>Is it not better,</hi>

                  <hi>not to vow, than to vow and not pay?</hi> For <hi>God takes no pleaſure in the Sacrifice of Fools.</hi> Have not you vowed to be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? to be more cloſe walking? to ſet up
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100523:33"/> the worſhip of God in your Veſſels? But, how have you come off with God? Have you not come off, as thoſe Heathen-Mariners did, who in a ſtorm promiſed, <hi>If their Gods would deliver them, they would offer up Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in ſacrifice to them, as big as the Maſts of the Ships;</hi> but when they got to Land, they made one of Twelve in the pound ſerve.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You are under more Advantages, to exert and draw-out Prayer; <hi>They that go down into the Sea, they ſee the wonders of the Lord:</hi> and theſe ſhould both excite to Prayer and Praiſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You muſt give an account to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies your Ship's Companies, are your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and you muſt give an account of them: you would not wrong them in their Wages, or in their Bodies, and why then will you wrong their Souls? you have a charge of Souls. But more of this herafter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you never pray out of danger, how can you expect to be heard in danger? will not God ſay as in that Caſe, <hi>You faſted not at</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Uſe.</hi> Then it is a word of Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: 1. It informs us of the ſin of thoſe that never pray, neither Calm nor Storm; that are poſſeſt with a dumb Devil: O that God would caſt him out! O the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condemn this! <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> condemn this. What, never pray? and yet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100523:33"/> called Chriſtians? O how ſtrange is this! are not many of your Houſes, and many of your Veſſels, haunted with a dumb De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?</p>
               <p n="1">1. You do not give the true God, ſo much Honour, as theſe Heathens gave to their falſe gods, <hi>They cryed to their gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The wrath of God hangs over the head of ſuch, as call not upon the Name of <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. You that have received mercyes, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Prayer at Sea, That duty you were moſt convinced of, be ſure you take up; and that ſin you were moſt convinced of, be ſure you lay down; Theſe uſually are true Convictions, that ſmite us in times of diſtreſs, and danger: there is a more than ordinary voice in ſuch Convictions, and they are in an eſpecial manner to be hearkned unto.</p>
               <p>The laſt <hi>Uſe</hi> is of Tryal. If the light of Nature put upon Prayer in time of Danger, O how ſhall I do to know, ſaith a poor Soul, whether I pray from a better Principle? from a higher Principle? If all my performances flow from only a Principle of Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; what a ſad caſe am I in? Take a few Tryals.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Are thy Duties forced and extorted from thee? O then, I doubt, it is not only Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience that thou acts from. Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s confeſſion of ſin. Thus <hi>Judas</hi>'s confeſſion. Thus <hi>Saul</hi>'s Theſe were all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from them, by the judgments of God upon them. This is like Sea-men, throwing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100523:35"/> goods over-board in a Storm, which they wiſh for again in a Calm. But now the Spirit of God brings a Soul freely off in dutyes; it <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51: 12.</note> is called a free Spirit. Alas, under an affliction, to have a Confeſſion forced from a poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, this is only to Pump, while in danger of drowning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If only Natural Conſcience acts you in duties, then it doth not act you conſtantly; it acts by fits: but now, the Spirit of the Lord acts the Soul more conſtantly; Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may bend the Bow, but doth not keep it bent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Natural Conſcience acts the Soul with no Complacency, or delight in God; now, Delight in God, is the Spring of duty. Now, Natural Conſcience cannot delight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with Spiritual Objects; <hi>Examine your hearts,</hi> then, What delight have you in God? in communion with Chriſt? Can you ſay, with the Spouſe, <hi>I ſate down under</hi>

                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>his ſhaddow with great delight:</hi> O this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of Natural Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Natural Conſcience hath Peace, if the duty be done, whether Chriſt or no be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; Divine preſence is not deſireable to Natural Conſcience: if it pay its vowes with the Harlot, and perform its task, then it is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 7 14.</note> quieted, and wipes its Mouth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Natural Conſcience looks not at the manner of duty, contends it ſelf in ſlubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100523:35"/> over the Lords work; but now, a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Grace cannot thus content it ſelf, but looks to the manner of performances.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Natural Conſcience gets no power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corruption, attending its dutyes;</hi> but pray's and ſins, and ſins and pray's: whereas Duties, acted by the Spirit of Chriſt, have power attending them ſooner or later.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Natural Conſcience, in all its duties, is a ſtranger to the Actings of Faith:</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convince of Unbeleif; it can riſe no higher than the light of Nature: but, What actings of Faith, are mingled with your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Natural Conſcience, ſo it gets its Ends, it never mind's its Returns:</hi> like the Leapers that were cleanſed; but did not return to give thanks. Natural Conſcience is not good at Thanks-giving. When it hath gotten the Mercy, it doth not ſtudy to return Praiſes: By theſe things, you may come to know whether your dutyes are acted by a higher Principle, than the light of Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

            <p>We come now to the Second Part of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100523:36"/> Text, (viz) <hi>The deportment of the guilty Perſon.</hi> (1) Here is his Perſon: <hi>Jonah,</hi> But <hi>Jonah</hi> &amp;c. (2) Here is his Place, whither he went down. He went <hi>down into the ſides of the Ship.</hi> Guilty Perſons are for holes and corners. (3) We have his Poſture, or what he was doing. Was he praying? wreſtling with his God, as they were with theirs? O no, he lay faſt a ſleep: <hi>he lay faſt aſleep:</hi> 1. The word ſeems to note unto us, his Compoſedneſs and Deliberateneſs in his <hi>ſleep,</hi> as a man that doth not accidentally take a Napp as he ſits, but he lyes down. O what a ſound ſleep was <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Conſcience in<hi>!</hi> 2. <hi>Faſt-a-ſleep,</hi> not eaſily awakened, therefore the Maſter calls unto him. We ſay of a Man that is in a ſound ſleep; he is <hi>faſt.</hi> So <hi>Jonah</hi> here was <hi>faſt.</hi> 4. We have the Aggravation of his ſin, he ſlept <hi>in the ſtorm.</hi> When others were ſinking, he was ſleeping: here is a black But written upon <hi>Jonah</hi>'s back. <hi>But,</hi> Jonah <hi>was faſt a ſleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. His ſin is aggravated by the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had upon him. <hi>But Jonah,</hi> the Iſraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Prophet. It was the Preacher <hi>Jonah,</hi> that was the ſleeper <hi>Jonah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His ſin is aggravated from the Guilt; It was guilty <hi>Jonah,</hi> that was ſleepy <hi>Jonah.</hi> for ſinning <hi>Jonah,</hi> to be ſleeping <hi>Jonah,</hi> is a great aggravation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Aggravation is from the Mariners-Practice:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100523:36"/> who were Heathens, and they praying; and he a Prophet of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and he ſleeping.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Aggravation from the Time: it was in a ſtorm, a Terrible ſtorm. He ſlept, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger was upon them all. In theſe things, lay the Aggravation of his Guilt.</p>
            <div type="observation">

               </list>
               <p>1. Let us inquire into his Guilt. We ſee the account of it given in this; His diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> a Call of God's, to go to preach at <hi>Nineveh.</hi> This was his guilt in the General: but it is worth a more particuler looking into.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Call and Commiſſion, were not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe.</hi> 1.</note> ordinary. <hi>Now the word of the Dord came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jonah.</hi> Here are his Letters Patents from Heaven: here is his Authority. If a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Man ſhould not be obeyed, it muſt be accounted for: men muſt Act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Commiſſion. But here is <hi>Jonah</hi> acting contrary to his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:100523:37"/> 2. His guilt lies in flat Rebellion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: he doth not excuſe himſelf, from <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 10.</note> any conceited weakneſs, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Lord I am ſlow of ſpeech, and of a ſlow tongue.</hi> This excuſe was modeſt: I am not ſufficient, ſome read it. I am not Eloquent, a very modeſt come off. <hi>I am of a heavy tongue,</hi> (ſo the Septuagint.) Now by the Hebrew-Canons, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>M.</hi> Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</note> (as one well obſerves) no Prieſt was to bleſs the People, that was of a ſtammering Tongue, nor was this a conſiderable Plea: But the Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> he makes no Plea for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but, without any more ado, he draws up a concluſion to flee for it: <hi>he aroſe and fled to Tarſhiſh,</hi> and thus proclaims his guilt. The Judg asks of the Priſoner, this queſtion; Did he flee from it? O then he is guilty by Law! O ſad! here is a Prophet turns Fugitive <hi>from the preſence of the Lord. Jonah,</hi> the name ſignifies <hi>a Dove.</hi> O how like one is he, in this reſpect? that he is upon the Wing, to be flying from the preſence of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His guilt lies in the deliberation of his Flight from God. It was no ſudden buſineſs, he went down to <hi>Joppa,</hi> Thirty Miles from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Sea-Port-Town. Now, Was not this very deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done? The more deliberation there is in an Act of ſin, the more there is of the will in that ſin; and ſo it becomes more ſinful. A poor Creature may be forced, and haled
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100523:37"/> on a ſudden, by the violence of a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into ſome ſinful act; but this is not ſo ſad. Therefore we read of that good Law; <hi>If ſhe was forced, ſhe was not guilty.</hi> God hath great compaſſion for theſe Spiritual Forces: But here was <hi>Jonah</hi>'s ſin, that he was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate in his flight.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His guilt lay alſo here, That he had been <hi>a Prophet in Iſrael,</hi> and there had ſeen the Lords great works done among that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. One would think he might have been armed and fortifyed, with ſo many experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as he had been under of the power of God, and faithfulneſs of God; and now to turn his back of the Lord's work, becauſe of ſome difficulty, that it ſeems to be attended withall: This goes to the making up of his guilt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His guilt lay <hi>in the pride of his Spirit,</hi> leſt he ſhould be reproached, to be a falſe Prophet. And this he ſeems to hint him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Was not this my ſaying, when I was in my own Country? Therefore I fled before thee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>to</hi> Tarſhiſh, <hi>for I knew that thou art a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God and merciful, and ſlow to Anger, and of great kindneſs, and repenteſt thee of the evil.</hi> O what Pride lurked in the Prophet's heart? O how often is this the Preacher's ſin: If he want ſucceſs, then their proud Spirits riſe. Was it not ſtrange? The Prophet
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100523:38"/> would rather have all <hi>Nineveh</hi> periſh, than his Name periſh, or be ſtained.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another piece of guilt lay in this: <hi>God did give him his Commiſſion,</hi> that he might fore-ſee the Rejection of the Jewes, his Country-men. Now this he takes no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. <hi>Ut, quia Iſrael audire contempſit, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Gentium mundus exaudiat.</hi> ſayes one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. His guilt lay, in <hi>the progreſs, he makes in his diſobedience.</hi> He doth not ſay, as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, My wayes are perverſe before the Lord; and if this thing diſpleaſe thee, I will get me back again.</hi> O no; when he goes down to <hi>Joppa,</hi> there he finds a Ship; he comes not now to a ſtand with himſelf, whether he ſhould go, or no; but payes the fare of the Ship: he continues ſtill in his courſe. Wel the ſtorm comes after him; and his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth ſtill ſleep: nay all of them pray, but <hi>Jonah.</hi> O ſad ſight! the Veſſel ſinking; the Heathen Mariners praying; but <hi>Jonah</hi> ſleeping.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Thing we are to inquire, is, into <hi>Jonah's</hi> ſleeping.</p>
               <p>1. It notes a ſleep of ſecurity, as Perſons when they think they are ſecure, they can ſleep ſoundly. Thus <hi>Siſera,</hi> thinking himſelf ſecure, fell a ſleep. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſecure, fell a ſleep, in the lap of <hi>Dalilah.</hi> So many Perſons fall a ſleep, in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100523:38"/> the lap of Creature-comforts and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>2. His ſleep notes his Senſeleſneſs and ſtupidity, as ſleed is the binding up of the Senſes: Here, no ſenſe ſeems to be upon ſleepy <hi>Jonah!</hi> The man is in a Lethargy; he muſt be cut, before he be cured, We read of a charge, that <hi>ſuch as ſin openly, ſhould be rebuked ſharply.</hi> But the word is, <hi>rebuke them (cuttingly):</hi> ſome tell us, that it is an Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto a man, that is in his ſleepy-diſeaſe, and muſt be cut for it. Nay it is well, if cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will recover him. O what ſenſe, now, had the Prophet of the Lords diſpleaſure, which he had ſtirred up againſt him? and ſhould have made him Tremble? The diſpleaſure of God put the Sea into a rage; yea the Heathen Mariners thought their Gods were angry, and yet <hi>Jonah</hi> thought not his God angry.</p>
               <p>2. What ſenſe was here, of his ſin, and provocation againſt God? his Conſcience at the preſence ſeemed to be <hi>Seared.</hi> A Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor taken from the Surgion, that ſeares a Member and makes it inſenſible.</p>
               <p>3. What Senſe was here, of God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour? What? ſenſible of neither Gods diſpleaſure! nor Gods diſhonour! Was it not diſhonorable for <hi>the Prophet of Iſrael,</hi> to flee from <hi>the God of Iſrael?</hi> He could be more ſenſible of the diſhonour to his own Name, than of diſhonour to Gods Name.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100523:39"/>
               <p> 4. What Senſe was there here, of his danger? The Mariners they were ſenſible of danger, and ſo they were afraid; but <hi>Jonah</hi> is no more ſenſible of danger, then a man in his Cabbin in a ſtorm. He is now, like <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s drunkard, <hi>aſleep in the top of the Maſt.</hi> Nay, many are ſenſible of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that are not ſenſible of ſin: But <hi>Jonah</hi> in this fit of the ſleepy diſeaſe, ſeems to be ſenſible of neither.</p>
               <p>5. What Senſe was here, of the danger of thoſe poor Seamen with him? Nature and Ingenuity might have taught him to have been ſenſible of other poor mens dangers, eſpecially he having been the procuring Cauſe of it. We ſee, he was ſo when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, <hi>For my ſake is this ſtorm come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you,</hi> &amp;c. Then put all theſe together, and it is evident, that, <hi>Jonah</hi>'s ſleep ſets out <hi>Jonah</hi>'s ſtupidity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, This ſleep,</hi> notes his Indulgence of himſelf under his Guilt. Whereas he ſhould have been ſentencing himſelf, and judging himſelf; he was with the Spouſe, indulging himſelf. <hi>He lay, and was faſt aſleep,</hi> crying with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſluggard; <hi>A little more ſleep, a little more ſlumber, a little more folding of the hands together!</hi> O when poor Souls fall into ſin, it is hard to get out of ſins ſleep! We are very prone to indulge our Selves therein.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100523:39"/>
               <p> 1. Reaſon why the Guilty Perſon is often the Secure Perſon, is, Becauſe <hi>Guilt cauſes God to with-draw,</hi> and when God with-draws from the Soul, it is no wonder if the Soul fall aſleep, fall into a fit of Security. <hi>Jonah,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>Was fleeing from the preſence of God,</hi> that keeps a Soul waking and watchful.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The preſence of God keeps the Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, as it is an enlightning preſence. Light will keep from ſleep. The Soul walks in the light of his Countenance, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſleep. <hi>They that ſleep, ſleep in the night.</hi> Darkneſs brings on ſleep. <hi>Jonah</hi> now was in the dark; he had ſinned the light of Gods comfortable preſence from him, and ſo fell a ſleep.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Quickning preſence of God, keeps Souls awake.</hi> When the Spouſe had loſt Chriſts quickning preſence, O what a Fit of Security fell ſhe into! When our graces loſe their activity, and turn into dull ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, then we preſently fall aſleep: When men ſit ſtill, they are ſoon aſleep. Thus <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> had ſinned away Gods quickning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſo <hi>fell aſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The preſence of God keeps men awake.</hi> As it keeps Believers upon their guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſnares and comforts of this preſent life. Theſe are the great Lullabyes of the Soul. Theſe are the <hi>Dalilahs</hi> in whoſe laps we fall aſleep, until we loſe our
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100523:40"/> ſtrength, and become as other Men.</p>
               <p>2. Reaſon. Why the guilty perſon is the ſecure perſon, is, <hi>Guilt contracts hardneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>the Conſcience.</hi> While tenderneſs is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the Soul is kept in a lively frame from ſleeping. Thus it was with the Spouſe untill ſhe ſinned-off her tenderneſs. When <hi>David</hi> had ſinned, how was he hardned in that ſound ſleep, for three quarters of a Year together? O what a hard heart had he under his guilt, at that time? We read of the City of <hi>Rabbah,</hi> what cruelty he did exerciſe <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. ult.</note> towards poor Creatures there, <hi>and he brought forth the People, and put them under Saws and Harrows of Iron, and under Axes, and made them paſs through the Brick-kiln &amp;c.</hi> We never read the like of <hi>David.</hi> O what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was there between <hi>David</hi> at this time! and when <hi>his heart ſmote him for the cutting of the lap of</hi> Sauls <hi>garment.</hi> Some do judge at this time he took in <hi>Rabbah,</hi> he was under his guilt with <hi>Bathſheba.</hi> It was then the ſpawn of his guilt that had thus hardned his heart. So in this caſe, O what a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart had ſeized upon <hi>Jonah!</hi> that he could be ſo faſt aſleep, in ſuch eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>3. Reaſon, Becauſe <hi>The Lord often ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers guilt to meet with ſucceſs.</hi> Now, Succeſs uſually is the Mother of Security. <hi>Jonah</hi> here meets with Succeſs in fleeing from the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100523:40"/> preſence of God. He goes down to <hi>Joppa,</hi> and there he finds a Ship, at that time bound where he was reſolved to go: now all this was for the tryal of <hi>Jonah.</hi> Many poor Souls when under guilt, if any thing favour them, (called <hi>a Providence,)</hi> they then think, Sure I am not running from God. Alas, <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful Providences in a way of ſin, are part of the puniſhment of that ſin;</hi> and, through the deceitfulneſs of our hearts, they are mighty hardning. You think, Go to Sea, you may be under Succeſs, and ſin too. Rubs in the way are a great mercy, to be check't in our purſuits of ſin. Diſappointments in a way of ſin have been bleſt to the turning of many Souls to God. Thus the Prodigal's diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments brought him home. And that of the Lord to the Church, <hi>I will hedg up thy</hi>

               <p>4. <hi>The guilty Perſon is often the Secure Perſon,</hi> Becauſe, Guilt dare not bring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the Reckoning. Guilt is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Fear. Now the Soul is as our firſt Parents were, when they had ſinned: They <hi>were afraid, and ran among the Trees of the Garden.</hi> So <hi>Jonah</hi> gets into the ſides of the Ship. As an indebted Perſon, cares not for reckoning his eſtate, nor looking into his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100523:41"/> Book; ſo, poor guilty Souls care not for looking into the Book of Conſcience; they run upon the ſcore ſtill. So did <hi>Jonah</hi> here, until God ſent after him.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>The guilty Perſon is often the Secure Perſon,</hi> becauſe, Guilt deafens the Soul to the Calls of God. The Lord calls upon poor deafned Sinners, yea upon Believers; Alas, they hear not! that it may be ſaid of them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>If</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not hear me; Lord, how ſhould</hi> Pharaoh <hi>hear me?</hi> Guilt gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Conſcience makes it both dumb and deaf: and O, what an uncomfortable thing it is, to ſpeak to the deaf? to preach to the deaf?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Guilty Perſons are ſecure as they are deaf to the voice of the Word. Guilt <note place="margin">

                  <p>Is it ſo, that the guilty Perſon is the ſecure Perſon? then it is, (1) a word of Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And it informs of the miſery of the Guilt and Security, when they meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they did here in <hi>Jonah:</hi> When a Soul lyes and cryes to God, under the ſenſe of guilt, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Lord heal my Soul for I have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> O this is a rich mercy! But, when a Soul is ſecure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his guilt, this ſpeaks the Soul in a ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. 1. Guilt and Security meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſpeaks the Soul to be benum'd, and Conſcience benum'd com's hardly to its ſelf. <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Conſcience by this guilt, was benum'd. O, benum'd Conſciences are ſad Commodities to carry to Sea with you! Thus <hi>David</hi> in the time of his guilt, had his Conſcience benum'd. 2. Guilt and Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty met together, ſpeaks the Spirit of God, abſent from the Soul. Thus it was with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.</hi> Thus with <hi>David, Take not thy holy</hi>

                     <hi>Spirit from me.</hi> And that was a Prayer he put up to God, when he was under guilt, he prayes as if he was afraid of a Total with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawment. 3. Guilt and Security, met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſpeaks Gods diſpleaſure upon the Soul. God was diſpleaſed with <hi>Jonah,</hi> and ſent this ſtorm after him. It was a ſtorm of God's Anger, and <hi>Who can ſtand before Gods Anger? according to his Fear, ſo is his Wrath.</hi> O how ſad is it to go to Sea under the Anger <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Second Uſe:</hi> Is it ſo, that the guilty Perſon is often the ſecure Perſon? then is it a word to Sea-faring Men; to Counſel them not to go to Sea under guilt and ſecurity, O what a mercy would it be to have guilt taken off your Conſciences; when you leave your Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and never (may be) ſee them more.

                  <p n="1">1. Carry not guilt with you, for your guilt will raiſe inward ſtorms. <hi>Then the Mariners were afraid,</hi> and alas, they knew nothing of the matter!

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100523:43"/> guilt did ſo; his guilt of Rebellion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Lords Commiſſion, did cauſe this great Tempteſt to be ſent after him. We read of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> a godly Prince, that he joyned himſelf with <hi>Ahaziah, who did wickedly,</hi> and they would ſend out a Fleet together. What became of this Naval Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of theirs? the Text tells us, <hi>The Lord broke their works, and their Ships,</hi> ſo <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 31.</note> that they were not able to go to <hi>Tarſhiſh:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9 26.</note> this was a Sea-port Town in the Land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> upon the Red-Sea.

O, will your guilty Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſay; This is come upon us for our ſakes, for our Land-ſins. Land-ſins many times brings Sea-dangers, You know, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens drew up that concluſion, <hi>He hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped</hi>

                     <hi>at Sea, and Vengeance follows him at Land.</hi> That guilt will be followed, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, that they concluded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Guilt will keep your Souls under the hidings of Gods face at Sea. It was a ſad Voyage, that <hi>Paul</hi> was in, when <hi>neither Moon nor Stars appeared for many days;</hi> but <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 27.</note> it is farr ſadder, when the light of Gods Countenance doth lye in; when it doth not appear: But at that time, the Angel came to him, and bid him <hi>Be of good chear.</hi> But now,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100523:43"/> to be in ſuch terrible ſtorms, and no Angel of Gods preſence with you; O how ſad will this be! O what would a ſmile of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled face be worth, when ſinking, when ſplitting? It was ſweetly ſaid of that Sea-Captain, when his Ship was on fire at Sea, and they thought they ſhould all be blown up immediately. <hi>Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is worth ten thouſand Worlds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Guilt will ſting your Souls at Sea, with fears of death. If poor Souls for whom Chriſt dyed, may be in fears of death, yea, all their lives; well then may guilty Souls at Sea be afraid of that <hi>King of Terrors.</hi> How ſad will it be for you, poor Mariners, to dye? to have none of your Relations about you, to be of uſe to you. To dye without ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! To dye ſuch a ſudden death! To dye out of your own Land! Will not all theſe things come in, to help on the trouble of your ſpirits; But now, if guilt be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Death is unſtung. You may ſay then when ſinking, <hi>O Death were is now thy ſting!</hi> And ſay, as that old Puritan Miniſter did in a ſtorm coming from <hi>New-England,</hi> when <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Sax<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton <hi>of</hi> Leeds <hi>in</hi> York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> they all were expecting the Veſſel to ſink, <hi>O, who is now for Heaven, who is bound for Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Guilt at Sea will be more dreadful to you, than at Land<hi>:</hi> becauſe, you are there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of thoſe helps, which you have here
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100523:44"/> at Land. You have not there, thoſe helps to unload your Conſciences, when they are burdened with the ſenſe of ſin. You may ſooner unload the Ship, then unload your Soul; there you have not any to be the Lord's <hi>Barnabas</hi>'s, Sons of Conſolation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: There you have not thoſe precious Ordinances to be Breaſts of Conſolation to you, when under the Senſe of guilt. O what would not your Souls give, if you ſhould fall under the Load and Burden of your ſins, for a poor Miniſter, that might tell but you of any glad tydings? Would not their feet be beautiful then, though their Perſons and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry be now deſpiſed, and ſlighted by you.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Uſe:</hi> Is it ſo that the guilty Perſon, is uſually the ſecure Perſon? then it is a word of Caution, both to Land-men, and Sea-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-men, all of us, one and other of us; take heed then of being Secure, under guilt, O this is moſt dangerous! Senſe of guilt may bring a Soul nearer God, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t ſtupidity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der guilt is very dangerous.</p>
                  <p>1. Take heed of Security under guilt, if once aſleep, it will be hard for you to be awakened, you ſee it was thus with <hi>Jonah.</hi> The Lord ſends a Tempeſt after him, and the Ship is like to be broken by it. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners they were afraid, they cry to their Gods, they lighten the Ship; yet all this while guilty <hi>Jonah</hi> was ſleepy <hi>Jonah,</hi> until
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100523:44"/> the Maſter of the Ship calls unto him, and preaches a rouzing Sermon unto him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ariſe, ſleeper, and pray unto thy God.</hi> Is <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſay</hi> 29. 10.</note> not a <hi>Spirit of deep ſleep and ſlumber</hi> fallen up-you? Nay, O that poor Miniſters had not cauſe to ſay, The Lord hath judicially poured it upon you! And if ſo, is it not hard to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken ſuch? If one ſhould come to the Grave-ſide, and Preach, and Pray, and Weep; would not you wonder? And what do poor Miniſters do every day? is not this their work, to preach to the dead? to pray over the dead ſecure Souls in their graves? Who, for all this, ſtirrs hand or foot after the Lord Jeſus? Was it not ſad in the time of the Plague, to hear that doleful Cry in the night, <hi>Bring out your dead, bring out your dead?</hi> and muſt that be the cry, yea all the cry of poor Miniſters; <hi>Throw out your dead,</hi> Throw out dead Souls, from your Congregations; through out dead Souls from your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
                  <p>Take heed of ſecurity under guilt, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity hath always been a fore-runner of ſome great Calamity, upon both Nations and Perſons: the ſecurity of <hi>Jonah,</hi> was the fore-runner of this great ſtorm; the ſecurity of the Old World, was a fore-runner of the Flood, the ſecurity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was a fore-runner of their Captivity.</p>
                  <p>3. Security under guilt, is a ſin that hath a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100523:45"/> wo written upon the Head of it. <hi>Wo to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>thoſe that are at eaſe in Zion.</hi> To be at <hi>Eaſe,</hi> and to be <hi>Secure,</hi> is all one in the <hi>Scripture-Dialect. Jonah</hi> was too much at eaſe, now, when all the Company was in danger, and ſo are there many that ſayl in the ſame Bottom with him.</p>
                  <p>4. Take heed of ſecurity, under guilt; for, the Lords judgments come upon ſuch in a way of ſurprize. Such Nations, or Perſons are not prepared to meet the Lord, in the way of his judgements: they are taken all on a ſudden, as the Fooliſh Virgins were, by the coming, and appearing of the Bride-groom. Now, it is very ſad, to have any judgment come upon us, by way of ſurprize. Sudden things bring much aſtoniſhment along with them; ſuch poor guilty Souls, as are ſecure, will ſay, I never thought of this, never thought of my death, this Voyage, never thought of ſinking! O, what a Fool am I, that ſhould no more think of my latter end.</p>
                  <p>5. Security under guilt grieves the Spirit of God. <hi>Jonah</hi> had now grieved the Spirit of God, and it let him ſleep: for it is the Spirit of God, that is the great keeper of the Soul awake. Nay, we keep awake no longer than the Spirit doth keep jogging of us, one way or other. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord came upon Sampſon,</hi> and what then? did he ſit ſtill? O
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100523:45"/> no! <hi>He aroſe and ſhook himſelf.</hi> But, when <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 45.</note> the Spirit of God is grieved, it ſayes to the Soul, as ſometimes Chriſt did to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Now, ſleep on.</hi> And how ſad is it, for the Spirit to let a poor Soul alone, to ſay, Sin on, ſleep on, <hi>He that is filthy, let him be ſo ſtill,</hi> and he that is unclean, let him be ſo ſtill.</p>
                  <p>But now, methinks, by this time, I here ſome poo ſouls ſay, I am the afraid Mariner: now, I ſee my danger; my danger, not of drowning only, but of damning; the fears of my ſinking, is turned now to fears of ſinking into Hell, of going down into the bottom of Hell. Now, I feel a ſtorm in my own boſom. And what are outward ſtorms, to inward ſtorms? and O now, ſayes the Soul, What ſhall ſuch a guilty Soul as I do! that hath ſuch a load of unpardoned guilt upon the back of my Soul? what ſhall I do under ſenſe of guilt!</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Direction to the guilty ſinner, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner. <hi>Cry to the Lord,</hi> under ſenſe of thy guilt. O what ſhall I cry, ſayes the Soul! If peradventure that thou periſh not, as theſe in Text did. What poor Soul, if thou have but a <hi>Peradventure</hi> to cry upon? to go upon, to the Lord? A divine <hi>it may be,</hi> may keep thy Soul from ſinking: Many a poor Soul have by the help of an <hi>it may be,</hi> gone to the Lord Jeſus. O guilty Souls, cry after Chriſt: what ſaid the Diſciples in that ſtorm they were
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100523:46"/> in, <hi>Lord careſt thou not that we periſh?</hi> What did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſtorm, when ſinking? <hi>Maſter ſave me, or elſe I periſh.</hi> So, poor guilty Soul, cry hard after Chriſt, Careſt thou not, Lord, that a poor Soul ſhould periſh? haſt thou not ſaid that thou cameſt into the World, that <hi>Whoſoever believes in him, might not periſh, but have everlaſting life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Art thou ſenſible of guilt? Then own the puniſhment of thine Iniquity. Thus did <hi>Jonah: For my ſake is this ſtorm come upon you.</hi> O what an ingenuous confeſſion was here, after God had awakened his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence!

                  <p n="3">3. Though you be not heard at firſt, cry again. Thus did <hi>Jonah, I will look again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thy holy Temple.</hi> O poor guilty ſinner, what may a look out of the Belly of Hell
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100523:46"/> towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt do? what though you ſee not mercy coming to you at firſt, yet look again, it may be the next look it will bring it; it is an excellent frame of Heart, to turn Faith's eye often Chriſt-ward under Senſe of guilt: this was the way that healing came to the ſtung <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> The ſting was the guilt of ſin; The <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> typed out the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Their <hi>look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was <hi>believing;</hi> Their <hi>healing</hi> was <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by pardoning grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Art thou under the Senſe of guilt; take heed of drawing black Concluſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy own Soul. This was the infirmity of <hi>Jonah, I ſaid, I am caſt out of thy ſight:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

               <q>So the Ship-Maſter came unto him, and ſaid unto him, what meaneſt thou O ſleeper! Ariſe and call upon thy God, if ſo be, that God will think upon us, that we periſh not.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>In the verſe before, you had a diſcovery of the deportment of a Ship-Company that were in diſtreſs: In this verſe, we have a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of further means, they uſe for their preſervation: ſome means you have had an Accompt of. Did they ſwear in their diſtreſs? did they prophane the Name of their Gods? did theſe Heathen Mariners do, as many who profeſs themſelvs Chriſtians, do? <hi>(viz.) Take the Name of God in vain?</hi> and ſo as that <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> King, <hi>who ſinned more and more, in the time of his diſtreſs:</hi> O no, <hi>They cryed to their Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Verſe, here you have further means uſed, for preſervation of their whole Ships-Company, in this great ſtorm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reprehenſion of guilt. <hi>So the Ship-Maſter</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:100523:47"/> 
               <hi>came unto him, and ſaid unto him, What meaneſt thou, O ſleeper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is exhortation to a duty. The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, To <hi>ariſe and call upon God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is the Motive, or Encouragement, the means are to be uſed upon. <hi>If ſo be that God will think upon us, that we periſh not,</hi> Here is no certainty; alas Idolaters can ſpeak at no Certainty. O, ſay they, though there be not a Certainty, yet there is a Probability of it; That our Prayer will be heard, and our Perſons preſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thing in the Text is <hi>the Reprehenſion.</hi> 1. We have the Perſon Reproving, <hi>The Ship-Maſter.</hi> Is not this a wonder, that a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> ſhould have more Senſe of the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his falſe Gods, than a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of the diſpleaſure of the true GOD? nay, a Ship-Maſter. Had it been ſome Chriſtian <hi>Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> fear might have put him upon it: But the Ship-Maſter, who had been uſed to ſtorms, he is afraid; and reproves a run-away Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>Here</hi> (ſayes one upon the place) <hi>ſee Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a Heathens Veſlel: not any of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners come to reprove him, but the Ship-maſter. The charge being his, he is careful to preſerve it; and, Rule being his, he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to maintain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is the <hi>Perſon Reproved,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Jonah;</hi> The fugitive Prophet, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord. The beſt of men, may
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100523:48"/> fall under a deſert to be reproved from the worſt of men. It had been far more proper for <hi>Jonah,</hi> to have been playing the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and to have been praying, with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Ships-company, than ſleeping in the ſides of the Ship. Here is a ſtrange ſight, a Prophet ſleeping, and a Heathen preaching; and he preaches very awakening Doctrine. <hi>Hriſe ſleeper, and call upon thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is the <hi>manner of the Reproof,</hi> [What meaneſt thou O ſleeper!] what aileth thee, thou profound ſleeper?

He ſpeaks by way of <hi>Admiration,</hi> that ever he ſhould be of ſuch a profound ſleep, in ſuch eminent danger, and ſo faſt aſleep. 2. By way of <hi>Excitation, what meaneſt thou?</hi> provoking him to ariſe, to ſtir up himſelf, to uſe what means he could for the preſervation of the whole. 3. By way of <hi>Recrimination,</hi> what, aſleep? and we all in this danger? what a ſhame is this? that thou ſhouldeſt be ſleeping, and we all ſinking? It is a verk ſharp Sarcaſm. What aſleep, and we all going down into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. 4. By way of vehement affection: Here was very much earneſtneſs of Spirit; <hi>what meaneſt thou, O ſleeper?</hi> he hath great affection for the preſervation of the whole.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is <hi>the ſin reproved,</hi> (viz.) for ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtorm of danger, neglect of the uſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100523:48"/> of lawful means for ſelf-preſervation: A ſin againſt the whole community, and Ships-company!</p>
            <p>2. Part of the Text is, <hi>The Exhortation.</hi> [Ariſe and call upon thy God.] We muſt ſhake our ſelves from our ſloath, before we can call upon God in an acceptable manner; ſleepy prayers are not acceptable prayers. Inward and out-ward man ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in calling upon God: <hi>and call upon thy God:</hi> not knowing what <hi>Jonah</hi> was, until afterwards, yet he had ſome expectation, that prayer might be heard; An excellent duty, at all times, but eſpecially in times of great diſtreſs, and danger; which was their Caſe at preſent; Calling upon their Gods in all Nations, being practiſed in times of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Calamity and Danger.</p>
            <p>3. Part of the Text is, <hi>The ground, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,</hi> to the duty. <hi>If ſo be God will Remember us,</hi> (ſo ſome read it.) If he will be ſo friendly and kind to us, (others read it). An [it may be] will put men upon ſerious endeavours for preſervation both for Soul and Body: an <hi>it may be</hi> of prevailing, will put Men upon Prayer.</p>
            <div n="1" type="observation">
               <head>Here are Two Obſervations.</head>
               <p>1. <hi>That ſuch as have Charges under their hands, ought faithfully to manage them.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:100523:49"/>
               <p> 2. <hi>Calling upon God is an excellent means to preſerve from Sea-ſtorms and dangers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Obſervation, <hi>Such as have Charges, under their hands, muſt faithfully manage them.</hi> Is not here an admirable Leſſon for Sea-Commanders, from this Ship-Maſter? ſee here! he concerned himſelf, not with one more immediately his charge; not a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but a Paſſenger; And all for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the whole. You little think, what charges you carry to Sea. I need not tell you what Ventures you ſtand charged with, what Goods, what Bills; your Ships, your Lives, your Goods, other men's Eſtates; your Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits. All this, you are ſenſible enough of, and concerned in<hi>:</hi> and it is your duty to be ſo. Honeſty is Honourable, both with God, and man: yet you muſt give me leave to mind you of other Ventures and Charges, that you carry to Sea with you; and muſt be accountable for.</p>
               <p>1. You ſtand charged with your own Souls; and is not this a great charge? Is not this Venture infinitely above all your other Ventures? all you carry, is but <hi>Lumber</hi> to your lives, and your very lives are but <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> to your Souls. If you that go to Sea, were but ſenſible of the worth of your Souls, it would ſurely awaken you? You ſend up many bills in this Congregation, to pray for ſuch a Relation gone a dangerous Voyage,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100523:49"/> but do you obſerve what dangerous Voyages ſuch Relations go, for their Souls? <hi>What ſhall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> Souls are the moſt precious Commodities in the world. Now the more precious your lading, and <hi>Cargo</hi> is; the more care you have of your Charge. The Souls you have aboard, are of far more worth, than all your Bills of Lading.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is not thy Soul a great charge? If thou miſcarry of thy Ship, thou maiſt get another; if thou miſcarry as to thy Soul, it is for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. If thou ſuffer Shipwrack, thou may'ſt recruit again; Friends and Acquaintances may ſupply thee again: But, if thou make Shipwrack of a Soul, thou never can'ſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit nor Recover that loſs. If thou be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Captive by the <hi>Turk,</hi> thou may'ſt be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, but <hi>the Redemption of the Soul ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Is not thy Soul a great Charge? It is of more value than all the Ships and Lading too. You ſay of a Ship, ſhe is richly Laden; but truly, the richeſt Commodities you can have Aboard, are your Precious Souls; theſe Immortal Souls are the <hi>Plate-Fleet</hi> that Satan, that arch-Pirate lays wait for; <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> We may gueſs at the worth of Souls, by the price was <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.</note> paid for them; They are <hi>Redeemed not with Silver nor Gold, but with the precious blood of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:100523:50"/> 3. Is not that a great Charge that you came into the world on purpoſe to provide for? You had not rational immortal Souls, given, for ſenſual employments; your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand into the world, was not to look after earthly comforts; but to provide for your future, and eternal Eſtates. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not created, as is ſaid of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan, To play in the mighty waters; There goes the Ships, there is the mighty Leviathan</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 104. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>that thou haſt made to play therein.</hi> As a good Miniſter ſaid once at Sea with his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Lord, what an Advantage haſt thou of me now:</hi> So may I ſay in this caſe, Will you neglect your Souls? To provide for them now, when you are every day in ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, when God hath ſuch advantages of you? What though you go your Voyages, and compaſs Sea and Land, and come richly and proſperouſly home? yet if you forget your Souls, alas all this while you mind not your main buſineſs; Other buſineſſes are but by-buſineſſes to your Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is not that a great Charge? that a man muſt give an account of, in every <hi>punctilio?</hi> What men muſt give an account of, they ſtand charged with: but things of little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, men are indifferent about them. O but, men muſt give an exact account to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>punctilio</hi> in reference to their Souls! You muſt give an account what purpoſes of ſoul
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100523:50"/> you once had, when in ſtorms, and ready to Shipwrack. O then have you reſolved, If God brought you off with your lives, to return to the Lord! you muſt give an account what Vows you made. If God would deliver you from ſuch a tempeſt, what new men you would become, what lives you would lead: O, all theſe will be charged upon you another day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is not that a great charge, which is an immortal Being? And ſuch a thing is the Soul of man. It muſt live after this life, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in eternal felicity, or in eternal miſery: O, do you think you carry immortal Souls to Sea with you! When you are to go a long Voyage, you lay in for it. And what? will you lay in nothing for Eternity? What, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for your immortal Souls? When news came to the Philoſopher that his Children were dead, <hi>I knew,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when I begot them, I begot Mortals.</hi> So ſhould you ſay, You know when you go to Sea, you carry im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls with you every Voyage; And, Go provided for them, becauſe you muſt give an account for them.</p>
               <p>2. You have another Charge: <hi>You carry the Souls of others with you,</hi> which is a great charge. The Maſter here concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all in the Veſſel. While he Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Jonah,</hi> and ſtirr'd him up to pray, he looked at the common good and ſafety of the whole Ships-Company. You have not only the charge of your mens bodies, but the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100523:51"/> charge of your mens Souls: When you are to give an Account to Owners, you will prepare all before hand, that you have no flawes in them. There is an Owner I am affraid you Sea-Commanders little think on, and you muſt give an account to Him; and this Owner is the <hi>LORD,</hi> the Owner of all the Souls in the Ship: and God expects you ſhould be faithful to the Souls you have under your Charge.</p>
               <p>1. You have the charge of <hi>Inſtructing</hi> them. You are to acquaint them with thoſe things that nearly Concern their precious Souls. Many Parents truſt their dear Children with you, and expect you ſhould both be faithful to their bodys and Souls: We read of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who had a noble Family; and it is ſaid <hi>he armed his trained Servants</hi> in the buſineſs of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Reſcue; his <hi>Inſtructed Servants</hi> (ſo the word ſignifies) not inſtructed only in Martial Diſcipline, but in the Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Souls; (ſome read it) his <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed</hi>

               <p> 2. You have the charge of <hi>praying</hi> with <note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. Your not calling upon the Lord, is the cauſe of all that Prophaneſs, and Atheiſm that abounds among you. There is a holy Majeſty in the worſhip of God, that if ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly performed, would have an awe upon men's Spirits. Will men believe there is a God? when they never ſee you call upon him: do not your Ships-Company, ſay in their hearts, <hi>There is no God?</hi> if there be a God, why is not he called upon? why is he not worſhipped? why is he not prayed unto? may not many of you Commanders ſay; Lord, forgive me, my other-mens ſinnes? O when your Company's ſins ſhall be laid at your doors, how ſad will this be? What a ſad reckoning will there be to anſwer for their ſwearing, and drinking, and blaſpheming God?

Many a childs Soul hath been given in as a return of Prayer, and many a Servants Soul. The Puritans loved the Souls of their Families, better than we

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100523:55"/> became an excellent Chriſtian afterwards. So, did but many Sea-Commanders, and other Mariners, hear what prayers are put up for them, by their Relations, by their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; O how would theſe melt their hearts?

Did you walk before them, as giving an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the fear of the Lord to them? Did you what you could, for the good of their precious Souls? Will it not be terrible in your ſtorms, when you are Sinking to have not only your own guilt to lie heavy upon you, but other mens guilt too? have not many upon their death-beds complained ſadly of the neglect of Family-duties; of the neglecting Souls under their Charges?</p>

               <p>We ſee theſe poor Heathens made it their practice now in danger, every one to call upon his God; they had their Temples, their Altars, their Aſylums to fly to, in time of diſtreſs; but alas theſe were poor ſhifts, Refuges of lies to them, lying <hi>Vanities,</hi> as all Idols are called.

                  <hi>fervent Prayers,</hi> working-prayers (ſo the Greek read it.) Are You, working for life and death? and the Seas working? and the Veſſel working? and ſhall not your Prayers be working? 1. Should not your prayers be fervent, now life lies at ſtake for it: men will pray hard for their lives; a poor Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, O how will he plead for his life! Let me continue a Priſoner, my Lord; Let me be Baniſhed; any thing, if my life may be but ſpared. O what will not a man do, or give for his life; And this is the caſe: it is upon your lives, and will not you pray fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently now? 2. Your Souls lye at ſtake, though this is not ſo much taken notice of, yet this is the great danger. What if thou
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100523:57"/> dye this ſtorm, and be found without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt? O, if you would but think when you go out to Sea, O Lord, What will become of my Soul, if I never return this Voyage? would there not be ſome hopes of you? poor Sinner, hath not the Lord ſaid, <hi>Without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee him;</hi> hath not the Lord ſaid, <hi>What will it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> hath he not ſaid, <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God!</hi> O now, what will become of your Souls, if you ſhould be caſt away before you could witneſs any thing of this nature wrought in you? then know, your Souls are concerned. 3. Your Wives, and Children, lye at ſtake, they are alſo concerned; will not this move you? think, How many of your Wives follows you with prayers both in private and publick? and would not this be both ingratitude and unfaithfulneſs for you not to pray when in danger? 4. What, not pray fervently in time of danger? Heathens do ſo. How did the worſhippers of <hi>Baal</hi>

What not pray earneſtly in times of danger! now, is a time for fears to get about the heart, and fear uſually ſends out prayer, <hi>the Marriners</hi> now <hi>were affraid.</hi> We do not read of the

Thoſe prayers, that are ſuch excellent means for preſervation from Sea-dangers, are to be preſented to God, by the hands of Chriſt: no prayers are prevailing prayers, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Land, or Sea, but ſuch.

The Angel that ſtood by <hi>Paul,</hi> when all the Ships-company were ſo nigh being caſt away, was Chriſt. Chriſt carries the prayers of poor Creatures unto his Father, when they are in dangers, and diſtreſs; and brings anſwers ſuddenly from Heaven, and ſo the ſtorm is quiet, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Calm. And you little, it may be, know how it comes. O Chriſt many times, prayes for it! no queſtion <hi>Paul</hi> had been praying for the preſervation of the Veſſel, when the Angel brought him that good news. <hi>All that ſayl with thee, are given thee.</hi> He had been begging their lives, and Jeſus Chriſt gives in the anſwer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thoſe Prayers, that are ſuch excellent means for preſervation, are unfeigned Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

Reaſon why Prayer is ſuch an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means for preſervation, becauſe, In this duty God's honour is highly concerned, this is Gods great Name, and Title, <hi>a God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer,</hi> in which he much glories. All his Attributes are much honoured, in calling upon him, eſpecially in times of dangers and diſtreſſes. 1. When you call upon God at Sea, you honour his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty over the Winds and Seas: is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by calling on him. God ſayes to theſe proud waves, <hi>So far and no further!</hi> So, <hi>the ſtorm and hail,</hi> they fulfil his will, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100523:60"/> when he pleaſes he commands a Calm. 2. Prayer in time of danger honours God's <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> when we ſee no way open, for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and deliverance to come in at, then to look up to him; believing, <hi>he knows how to deliver out of Temptation.</hi> O, how much of the wiſdom of God appears in preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in time of danger? and is it not a good token of mercy coming in, when Perſons pray, though all viſible wayes are block't up? this honours God's <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg is never at a loſs, as to wayes of bringing in mercy and deliverance. 3. The <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of God is much honoured in times of danger, when he is called upon, the faithfulneſs of a Friend doth moſt appear in a ſtrait: now, if you can rely upon his Promiſe, Gods faithfulneſs is the beſt line, men ſinking at Sea can lay hold on. So I might add, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God, honours all his other <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Reaſon, becauſe the promiſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation runs to Prayer. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> here is the Precept; Is not a day of trouble, a time of danger? Is it <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 14.</note> not a day of trouble, when, it may be, but a few ſteps are betwixt you and death; nay betwixt you, and Hell? Is not it a day of trouble <hi>when your ſins encompaſs you about?</hi> when <hi>the fears of death take bold on you?</hi> when you muſt never ſee Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100523:60"/> Friends, and Relations more? well, what ſhould you do then? O then, call upon God, <hi>and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> Thou for any thing I know, may have thy mercy for a while, unasked; but, I tell thee from the Lord, Thy preſervations and deliverances may be Curſes to thee. When men are delivered from Sea, and fall into their Wickedneſſes again, they are a Curſe to them; when they ſay, <hi>They are delivered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>to do all theſe abominations.</hi> You have your deliverances, but you have not them in a way of promiſe, you have them not in a way of prayer; theſe unſought-for mercies, are uſually Curſes to the Receivers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe, Prayers in times of danger u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually are accompanied with the Exerciſe of grace<hi>:</hi> now the greateſt deliverances come in away of the exerciſe of grace. Grace lyes dormant until it be awakened by danger: they are not ſleepy habits, that uſually deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance comes in upon, but when grace is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. When came that Preſervation to the Diſciples at Sea, in that dreadful ſtorm, but when <hi>the Ship was covered with waves?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marke</hi> 4. 37.</note> Jeſus Chriſt was there then, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.</p>
               <p>1. There is in Prayers, in time of danger, faith exerciſed. Now to go to God in faith, in time of trouble, O, what a great mercy is this? Of all men in the World, Who have
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100523:61"/> more need of faith, then Sea-men! Can you go through your dangers and difficulties, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? Is it not this the <hi>Ariadne's</hi> clew (that the Poets feigned) would lead and extricate through all <hi>Labyrinths?</hi> You Say, ſuch a Veſſel is gone to the <hi>Straits;</hi> you will go to the <hi>Straits</hi> every Voyage you make, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith<hi>:</hi> this is your <hi>Anchor,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is your <hi>Cable,</hi> that in all ſtorms and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, you muſt make uſe of; 2. In Prayer in time of danger, there is <hi>Patience</hi> exerciſed. Then mens Patience is tryed; God loves to ſee us lye quietly ſubmitting to his will, and then comes deliverance: the cryes of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience do but clip the Wings of Mercy that it cannot fly, ſo ſwiftly towards us, as it would. To how many thouſand Sea-men, may the Lord ſay, as once to thoſe Diſciples? <hi>Why are ye ſo fearful, O ye of little faith!</hi> O ye of little Patience! Is repining and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring the way to deliver, think you? <hi>3ly.</hi> In Prayer in time of danger, there is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Repentance;</hi> and Confeſſion of ſin; Thus <hi>Jonah,</hi> when God and his Conſcience arreſts him; then the Malefactor, and grand Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent confeſſes. This is the going of the Pump, when <hi>Repentance</hi> is in exerciſe. Now Deliverances uſually comes in upon this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe: <hi>Whoſoever knows the Plague of his</hi>

                  <p>Is it ſo, that prayer is an excellent means for preſervation at Sea, in time of Danger; Firſt it is a word of Counſel. 1.

Of all perſons, they ſhould look to it, that they ſin not againſt the Lord, who hath done ſuch great things for them.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt word of Counſel</hi> is, Live anſwerably to your Preſervations. How uncomely! nay how ſinful is it, daily to live upon mercy, and daily to live below mercy? After ſuch Deliverances as this, ſhall we break again his Commandements? May not a <hi>None-Such</hi> be written upon the head of this Deliverance, and Preſervation? yea, and may not a <hi>None-Such</hi> be writ on the head of this ſin, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation? Check your ſelves in your ſins, by the Remembrance of your mercies. Was I delivered to do all theſe abominations? Was I delivered from Sea, and ſaved from Hell, at ſuch a time, To live in ſuch a ſin? To be Drunk? To Swear? To abuſe my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? To Scoff and Mock at Godlineſs? O, May'ſt thou not hear God ſaying to thy Soul? <hi>Is this thy kindneſs to thy Friend?</hi> wilt <hi>thou thus requite the Lord, fooliſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi>

                     <hi>Second word of Counſel;</hi> O, Labour to keep the ſenſe of them freſh upon your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits! when we loſe the ſenſe of the mercy, then we are eaſily drawn into ſin, againſt the God of mercy; O, while mercies are new, they affect us! as every Condition at firſt, is taking, but afterwards it is not ſo. It is with mercies, as with the Children of <hi>Iſrael, they ſang and gave praiſe.</hi> But yet we find all off again, <hi>Pſal</hi> 106. 12. <hi>They made haſt to forget,</hi> they ridd poſt (as it is in the <hi>Heb.)</hi> to forget. 1. Keep the ſenſe of danger up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hearts. When we loſe the ſenſe of our dangers, we loſe the ſenſe of our duties. O
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100523:63"/> what a danger was I in, at ſuch a time? what diſtreſs, and ſaid with good <hi>Jehoſophat,</hi> I <hi>know not what to do?</hi> It is good to reflect on, paſt dangers; ſo <hi>David, there came a Lyon, and a Bear,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Keep the ſenſe of the Deliverance on you; if it wear off, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the mercy is blaſted; it will then look like an old withered mercy. God would have his mercies freſh to us, to look with a freſh Complexion. 3. Keep the ſenſe of your Vows, upon you, the Vows that your Souls uttered in the time of your diſtreſs. 4. Keep the ſenſe of your preſent frames of Heart, you had upon you, when you were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; whether your ſins compaſſed you about in that day or no; Conſider, whether you were under the ſmiles of his reconciled face, or no, in dangers, O what would you not then have given for the Pardon of your ſins! 5. Keep the ſenſe of your ſins upon you, that ſtared your Conſciences in the face, in your dangers. Is that ſin mortified, yet? Is that ſin forſaken? Theſe things we ſhould keep freſh upon our Souls, after our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</p>

                     <hi>Third word of Counſel;</hi> O, then let your Preſervations from paſt dangers, be obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon you to truſt God in future ſtraits, <hi>The Lord delivered me</hi> (ſaies <hi>David) out of the Paw of the Lyon, and the Paw of the Bear,</hi> and what then? <hi>and he will deliver me out of</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourth word of Counſel,</hi> O beg of God, your Deliverances, and Preſervations, may be all ſent ſanctified unto you! There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls have unſanctified mercies, unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied enjoyments, Deliverances, and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; alas theſe will harden poor Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Sentence is not ſpeedily Executed, therefore are the hearts of ſinners hardened: They eſcape this danger, and the other, and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 11.</note> ſo they think they ſhall alwaies eſcape.</p>
                  <p>It will here be demanded, When a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is ſanctified?</p>
                  <p>1. When it is joyned with Holineſs: We read of Deliverance and Holineſs upon <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obad.</hi> 17.</note> Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> when Deliverances ſhine in the Holineſs of mens Converſation. To be delivered, and follow your ſins more greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is no ſigne, Deliverance is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>2dly. When they abide upon the Heart, they are ſanctified; when they remain, with a Soul. Many, many, have Preſervations
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100523:64"/> from danger, and as ſoon as they are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all is paſt, and gone with them, as a tale that is told. It may be they never think of them, till they come into another danger, or another ſtrait.</p>
                  <p>3dly. When deliverances are ſanctified, they are admired. After ſuch Deliverance as this! O how their Hearts admired, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! You loſe the beauty of a mercy, for want of admiring-frames of Heart; In this Deliverance, ſaies the Soul, here was the appearance, of the ſeveral attributes of God; here in this circumſtance, was the wiſdome of <hi>God,</hi> and the Power of <hi>God!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4thly. When Deliverances do kindly humble, and break the Soul, then they are ſanctified! what, ſave ſuch a worm? put forth his power to ſave, at ſuch a time, from Death, and Hell, ſuch a poor, vile wretch? that deſerved to have been lodged in that Pit, where there is no Redemption many years agoe.</p>
                  <p>5thly. When Deliverances are ſanctified, they endear the Soul exceedingly in love with <hi>God;</hi> Thus <hi>David,</hi> I will love thee, O <note place="margin">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100523:68"/> O then examine, whether your Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been fruits of prayer, anſwers unto prayer: O, it is a ſweet thing to read an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of prayer in preſervation! to ſay, Lord, thou, haſt heard my Cry, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me.</p>
                  <p>1. A Preſervation that is a fruit of prayer, is a Perſervation that alwaies endears the Soul unto God. <hi>I will love thee, O Lord my ſtrength.</hi> O what a warm frame of Heart was <note place="margin">

                  <p>2dly. A Preſervation that is a fruit of Prayer, alwaies raiſes the Souls of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers in praiſe. <hi>That which we win by Prayer, we wear by praiſe:</hi> What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, men are ſo ingrateful, and unthankful for theſe Preſervations? They are not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of prayer.</p>
                  <p>3dly. A Preſervation, that is a fruit of Prayer, will cauſe the Soul to believe in the next ſtrait, it is brought into. It binds the Soul over to believe for the future: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of prayer always bind over the Soul to believe, He hath delivered me, and he will deliver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4thly. Preſervations that are anſwers to prayer, they fill the Soul with admiration.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100523:69"/> ſuch Souls go round about their preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and look ſtedfaſtly upon every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſo ſee the beauty of its preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

            <p>WEe have already had an account, how ſerious theſe poor diſtreſſed Mariners were in their danger; as to their uſe of means: 1. Rational means, <hi>They lighted the Ship.</hi> 2.

            <p n="1">1. In the Text, we have a ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation of a poor diſtreſſed Ship-company, in eminent danger. Dangers will make men ſerious in their Conſultations. <hi>And they ſaid every one to his Fellow, Come let us caſt Lots.</hi> The ſtorm growing upon them, though they had uſed rational and religious means. <hi>(Jonah</hi> having not confeſſed his ſin); they begin to think that the ſtorm came upon ſome extraordinary errand, and might be ſome extraordinary Meſſenger or Purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to Arreſt ſome great Malefactor. And therefore, they fall upon a Conſultation to uſe extraordinary means, in order to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the guilty Perſon. And this is the caſting of Lots. The uſe of the Lot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in difficult caſes, to leave it to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God to decide the Controverſie.

So they conſult to caſt Lotts.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

Some will ſtay by the Veſſel, and ſome will take them to their Boat: and both the divided Parties many times loſt. Dividing, in time of common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100523:70"/> and diſtreſs, is frequently of ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. But we ſee here they all reſolve upon one courſe, which ſhould teach Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sea-men to be united in their courſe and Reſolution, in time of diſtreſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have the main ſcope, and end of this ſerious Conſultation. <hi>That we may know for whoſe cauſe this Evil is come upon us.</hi> They had ſtrong apprehenſions, that the Caſe was extraordinary; and gladly would they find it out. They do not every one reflect upon one, and ſay, <hi>Is it I? Is it I?</hi> O no, but they put it off from one another; and yet all are in good earneſt for a diſcovery of the cauſe. But <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> is ſilent, all this while, ſays nothing, They had this Notion, that <hi>ſome extraordinary guilt raiſed this Storm.</hi> There was ſome Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor aboard, and, as they ſaid, when <hi>Paul</hi> came a ſhoar, and the Viper came upon his <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 4.</note> hand, <hi>No doubt this man is a Murderer, whom though he eſcaped the Sea, yet vengeance ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not to live.</hi> So theſe poor Pagans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Some great Malefactor was aboard, this ſtorm purſued to take Vengeance of. 2. Here is this in it alſo, that they gave up the diſcovery to the determination of the Lot; <hi>That we may know for whoſe cauſe this Evil is come upon us:</hi> We will be decided by the Lot; whom the Lot will fall upon. They attributed ſuch a Divinity to Lots, that they were willing the Controverſie ſhould be ended by them.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:100523:71"/>
            <p> 4. We have the controverſie devided, and the Malefactor diſcovered. <hi>And the Lot fell upon</hi> Jonah. Before he was reproved, and might have been vehemently ſuſpected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſleep, in ſuch a ſtorm. But here he is plainly and openly diſcovered, and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in an extraordinary way too. His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not ſtartled, at the Mariners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; though he be awake, his Conſcience is aſleep ſtill; he doth not cry out, <hi>I am the man,</hi> for whoſe cauſe this Evil is come upon You. I am the Malefactor ſent after, by this ſtorm. O no, ſo hard it is to acknowledg our guilt, and take ſhame to our ſelves.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100523:72"/> is decided, that he is the guilty Malefactor, that hath cauſed this great ſtorm.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Is it not a righteous thing, that when the guilty Malefactor hath fled, and the Hue and Cry ſent out after him, takes him; that he ſhould be tryed, condemned, and executed? Alas, poor Sea-men, you are the Malefactors, God is the Judg, and your extraordinary Storms, are the <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry</hi> ſent out to Sea after you. May not you

Now in theſe extraordinary ſtorms (poor Sea-men) God is dealing with you. It may be, at home Miniſters were dealing with you, and God's Ordinances dealing with you, and Relations dealing with you, that you would look about you, for your immortal Souls.

Now God doth not without a cauſe bring poor creatures into diſtreſſes. 1. Now poor Sea-men in their ſtorms, are diſtreſſed with <hi>their ſins, compaſſing them about.</hi> Now <note place="margin">

O, is not this a great diſtreſs, when death and unpardoned guilt looks a poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the face, at the ſame time? To have all your ſins before you, now when Death, that <hi>King of Terrors</hi> comes forth againſt you; this is to be in great diſtreſs. 2. In ſtorms, fears make diſtreſs. And God would not bring Sinners into fears without Cauſe. The Mariners now were affraid, as hath been noted before. Fear is ſuch a diſtreſs, that we read a promiſe <hi>to be delivered from the fear of Evil;</hi> not only from the <hi>Evil,</hi> but the <hi>Fear</hi> of it. Fears of death, are as terrible to ſome, as Death it ſelf. 3. In ſtorms, <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:100523:75"/> they are diſtreſſed under the ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure. O, this is a ſtorm in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger! and, if God withdraw not his Anger, all the proud helpers ſtoop under him; <hi>all the helpers of pride</hi> (as the Dutch Annotators obſerve), They that arrogantly preſume, they can help themſelves out of the diſtreſs. Alas, the Stout-hearted Mariners, the moſt couragious Sea-men in the world will ſtoop under <hi>Him.</hi> God is not Angry without a Cauſe. Is not this diſtreſs, To be under the ſenſe of divine diſpleaſure? Ask <hi>David,</hi> and he will tell you; <hi>he had no reſt in his bones becauſe of Gods Anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. In ſtorms, they are diſtreſſed under Terrors of Spirit about their Eternal Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. No ſuch diſtreſſes, as Soul-diſtreſſes. If it come to this once, O what will become of my immortal Soul? If I die and ſink in this ſtorm, do not I go to Hell? now, I think, the Soul is in diſtreſs enough! It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the Soul be in diſtreſs, when it is to die, and knows not whither it ſhall go, but beſpeaks it ſelf, as he did, <hi>O poor wandring Soul, whither art thou going?</hi> thou muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſport it more. 5. In ſtorms they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed with thoughts of their dear Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and one-while they think of their preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls, and thoſe thoughts cut them to the Heart? Another-while, they think of their dear pieces of themſelves, their Wives and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100523:76"/> Children, and theſe thoughts, as daggers, go to their Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus are they hurried and diſtreſſed in their Spirits. Now God would not bring ſuch diſtreſſes upon Sinners without a Cauſe.</p>
               <p>4. Becauſe extraordinary ſtorms are the ſad effects of Gods diſpleaſure againſt poor Sinners. Was the Lord diſpleaſed againſt the Rivers? <hi>Was thine Anger againſt the</hi>

So, may not we ſay of this like terrible Tempeſt, Was not the Lords Anger againſt the Sea-men, againſt their Relations, againſt the whole Land? God was Angry with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> when he <hi>ſent</hi> this ſtorm after him. And had he not good cauſe? 1.

God had good cauſe to be angry with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah?</hi> he is ſecure under his guilt; and this is a great Provocation unto the Lord. If a poor Soul fall into ſin, and <hi>quickly</hi> be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it; O then, God is ready to forgive. But, when a poor Soul ſleeps on, and ſins on, (which was <hi>Jonah</hi>'s caſe,) this is a great Provocation unto the Lord. <hi>He was aſleep.</hi> 3. <hi>God</hi> had good cauſe to be angry, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing as well as ſending the ſtorm, for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> is exceeding diſingenuous with <hi>God</hi> and his Conſcience. What Calls had he, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake? The Maſter Reproves him; one would have thought that might have ſet his Conſcience on work. The poor Heathen Mariner's cry, Every one calling upon his <hi>God</hi> (one would have thought) might have brought him to conſider, how he had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>God.</hi> The very caſting out their wares, might have occaſioned him to think what guilt he was under to endanger all the poor innocent mens lives. But (you ſee) he puts all off to the laſt. Until he is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Lot;</hi> nay when he is diſcovered, he is not yet ingenuous; but ſtands their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination before he confeſs that it was for his ſake, that this ſtorm came upon them; Muſt not this needs be a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This was <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Calling: O, how forward ſhould he have been, to prove an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bringing ſo many thouſands of Souls to Repentance, that lived in ſuch a City! O, how he ſhould have rejoyced in ſuch an employment! to have ſaved Souls from death! What an occaſion was this for God, to be angry? to be a Preacher to Souls, and not a lover of Souls? 5. God had good Cauſe to be angry with <hi>Jonah,</hi> becauſe he mattered his own name more than God's. This was his Temptation as hath been hinted before. What? for an Ambaſſador to a King, to ſtand more upon his own name than his Maſter's, that gave him his Commiſſion? What a Provocation is this! What, a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? and have ſo little Regard to the Glory of God, and the good of Souls? To regard our Reputation more, than the honour of him that ſent us, and the Salvation of precious Souls, muſt not this cauſe God to be angry? This is the caſe, poor Sea-men, in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtormes; You ſhould ſay, Now the Lord is Angry, and God is diſpleaſed with us, and is he ever angry without a cauſe? now in ſuch ſtorms, he is ſaying to you as the Lord to them, <hi>Thy way, and thy doings have procured theſe things unto thee, This is</hi>

                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 7, 8.</note> God hath Purſevants at command, to ſend after guilty Sinners where ever they are. That very Voyage, that you think, poor Seamen, ſhall be the ſafeſt; that very Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſhall be the moſt dangerous, if God have a controverſy with you: Nay, when you come home in your own Channel, which is a great aggravation of your Affliction, there you ſhall miſcarry. Nay, Here in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as ſome have done of late, if God have a controverſy with you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>5ly.</hi> O, give not God cauſe to take up a Controverſy againſt you for then you will
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100523:81"/> have nothing to plead for your ſelves, when God in his Providences is pleading againſt you. O then, poor Sea-men, you will be Speechleſs, you will have nothing to ſay for your ſelves. Thus it was with <hi>Jonah,</hi> He juſtifies God in his righteous Judgment, and condemns himſelf: <hi>For my ſake is this ſtorm come upon you.</hi> Then you will, in your Souls conclude; <hi>the Lord is righteous,</hi> but you are wicked, and this ſtorm is now the fruit of your wickedneſs. Haſt thou a word to ſay poor drunken Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, poor profane Seaman, why thou ſhouldſt not periſh this ſtorm, why thou ſhouldſt not ſink to the bottom, this ſtorm?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>6ly.</hi> O, give not God cauſe to take up a Controverſy againſt you! The Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy will be againſt your <hi>Souls,</hi> if you do. Now, this is the ſadeſt Controverſy in the world, a Controverſy againſt a <hi>Ship</hi> is not ſo ſad; a Controverſy againſt <hi>Eſtates,</hi> nay, <hi>Lives,</hi> is not ſo ſad<hi>:</hi> But for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy to lie againſt precious <hi>Souls,</hi> this is ſadeſt of all. <hi>This night thy Soul ſhall be taken away.</hi> The Controverſy lay againſt his Soul. O, for God to ſay to a poor Sea-man in a ſtormy night, <hi>Thou fool, this night will thy Soul be taken away;</hi> this is a ſad ſtory, thy ſoul is now to be caſt away. Few pity caſt-away Souls.</p>
                  <p>Alas, the body is but the Cabbinet, the Soul is the Jewel. And though the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100523:81"/> Cabbinet ſhould be caſt away, if thou knew that thy Soul were ſafe, the breaking or drowning of the Cabbinet, would not be ſo Terrible to thee.</p>
                  <p>Second word of <hi>Counſel.</hi> If extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtorms be not ſent from God without a cauſe, then be counſelled, poor Sea-men, and your Relations, to make your peace with God. O, venture not to Sea, untill <hi>this work</hi> be done. Doſt thou know what a venture thou runneſt every voyage that thou makeſt, and thy Soul unreconciled to God? O then, you of the Tribe of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulun,</hi> might <hi>Rejoyce in going out!</hi> then you might leave your dear Relations with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, if not to ſee them again in this world, yet to ſee them in a better, where you ſhall be <hi>ever with the Lord.</hi> O, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Sea-men and their Relations, being at peace with God, if they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered, would ſtir you all up with might and main to this work.</p>
                  <p>1. If you were at peace with God, then you might lift up your face with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to God in all your dangers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes.

                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> If you were at peace with God, then you might expect all your diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and loſſes, would be ſanctified to you. Many of you go to Sea, and meet with Shipwracks (though it is a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to have your lives ſpared) yet many of you, have breaches made upon you, as the Breaches of the Sea, breaches upon your Eſtates; it may be, God gives an eſtate for one 7 years, and takes it away the next; and after that he hath lifted you up, he caſts you down<hi>:</hi> Now, O what a mercy would this be, if your Souls and your Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might prove gainers by theſe loſſes! and peace made with God would bring on this mercy, <hi>All things ſhall work together for the good of ſuch,</hi> all his diſpenſations are mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out in love to ſuch. No ſtorm is in wrath to ſuch; O, ſayes God to ſuch, <hi>Fury is not in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly.</hi> If you were at peace with God; then you might expect to carry the eſpecial bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Gods protection out with you. This
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100523:82"/> was the bleſſing that <hi>Moſes</hi> bleſſed the Tribe of <hi>Zebulun</hi> with, <hi>Rejoyce, O</hi> Zebulun, <hi>in they going out:</hi> whether it was to war, or to trade, (as Interpreters hold, it may be both); it was a great bleſſing <hi>to go cut Rejoycing,</hi> under their hopes of the protection of God. O then his Banner over you would be love, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Voyage; and this the beſt Ancient or Enſigne that your Ship can carry forth with you. This is your beſt <hi>colours,</hi> to put forth in caſe you meet with an Enemy. This Banner can <hi>cover your heads in the day of Battel.</hi> This eſpecial Protection of God, is the Beſt Pilot to ſteer you. You may talk of a <hi>Protection</hi> from <hi>Man,</hi> but this is the only Protection, that will do you good.</p>
                  <p>4. If you were at peace with God, you might then expect his comfortable Soul-revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preſence, in all your ſtorms and dangers: And, Is not his preſence brave Company in diſtreſs? O, what a cordial was that word to their fainting Spirits? when the Diſciples were in that terrible ſtorm at Sea! <hi>Be of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>good cheer, It is I, be not afraid;</hi> they cry, <hi>Lord ſave us,</hi> and then Chriſt appears to them and calls to them. O, what a comfortable night had <hi>Paul,</hi> though in that ſtorm, when the Angel ſtood by him and ſaid, <hi>Paul, be of good cheer; all that ſayl with thee are given to thee.</hi> For God to give you the comfort of that promiſe, <hi>When thou goeſt through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:100523:83"/> 
                     <hi>I will be with thee.</hi> This raiſes wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the heart of a poor Believer.</p>
                  <p>If you were at Peace with God, then you would in ſome comfortable meaſure be lifted up above fears: and can there be fear, but there is torment in it? O what a mercy would it be, when <hi>in the Valley of the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death,</hi> then, <hi>to fear no evil,</hi> but to have your heart fixed, truſting in the Lord. But this hath been hinted before.</p>
                  <p>6. If you were at Peace with God; then Death would not have that dread in it. This would unſting Death; Then your hearts would not ſo ſadly <hi>meditate Terror,</hi> when Death <hi>the King of Terrors</hi> ſhall look you in the Face. Might not you then ſay, <hi>O death where is thy ſting! O Grave or Sea, where is thy Victory?</hi> while others tremble at the thoughts of it, you might tryumph in your comfortable expectations of it, holding out your Hands, and Arms, ſaying, <hi>Now</hi> Lord <hi>let thy Servant depart in Peace;</hi> Then you may make ready to <hi>ſwim</hi> to the boſome of the Lord Jeſus; it is but thy Body, thy Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net that is loſt, that is caſt away. The Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and Treaſure is taken up by Chriſt; that comes ſafe to ſhoar, through all the ſtorms and tempeſts that can blow.</p>
                  <p>7. If you were at peace with God, then you are ready for whatſoever diſpenſations of God ſhall come upon you, you go out
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100523:83"/> poor Sea-men, and you cannot tell what attends you: a thouſand dangers wait upon you: and O, how ſad is it to be ſurprized by any affliction at Sea! If a Ship be not loſt by water and wind, it may be by fire: or, thou mayeſt ſpring a leak in a calme, if not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in a ſtorm; or, thou mayeſt be taken by Pyrats; or, thou mayeſt dye of the Country Diſeaſes whither thou goeſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, O now, what a mercy would it be, to be ready for any danger that may befall thee? O, what care is taken in getting all things ready, when you are to go to Sea; but what little care is taken to be thus ready, not knowing what you may meet with? It is a ſad thing to be ſurprized. <hi>Fearfulneſs ſhall ſurprize the Hypocrite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second</hi> Word of Comfort to Sea-men: Let them juſtify God, in extraordinary ſtorms. How impatient many times are your Spirits? are you not, as the Prophet ſaid of them, <hi>Full of the fury of the Lord? like a wild Bull in a Net.</hi> Are not you in a greater ſtorm, then the Sea, are not your Spirits like <hi>the troubled Sea, that caſts forth nothing but myre and dirt?</hi> ſhould not you ſay rather, Lord, thou art righteous, and we are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? ſhould not you <hi>accept the puniſhment of your Iniquity?</hi> as <hi>Jonah</hi> did, <hi>Caſt me into the Sea, and it will be calme unto you. For I know that for my ſake this great Evil is come upon you.</hi>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Third</hi> Word of Counſel, to Sea-men O then learn to fear God! when he ſends forth extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtorms; then learn to fear God. He doth it not without a cauſe: You ſee, it is ſaid of theſe poor Heathens; <hi>Then they feared the Lord exceedingly, and ſacrificed and made Vowes.</hi> The terrible diſpenſation of God, either at Land or Sea, ſhould be improved to the begetting the fear of God in us. So it was, when <hi>the Lord ſent Thunder and Rain,</hi> in <hi>Samuels</hi> time, <hi>in Harveſt, and,</hi> ſayes the Text, <hi>The People feared the Lord:</hi> yea, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>greatly feared the Lord, and Samuel.</hi> What not fear him who made both Sea, and Land, and can ſhake both with a word of his mouth, and <hi>vex them in his ſere displeaſure?</hi> 1. Of all men you ſhould fear the Lord, that ſee the wonders of the Lord. Should not the ſight of his wondrous works ſtrike you with the fear of God? as the Old Man that was asked by the Philoſopher, how he came to know ſo much of God, and could not read: ſaith he, <hi>I have only one book, and this book hath three leaves, and I get my Learning here. This book is the Creation,</hi> (ſayes the Old Man) the three leaves are the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>Sea;</hi> and all Creatures in theſe are as ſo many words, out of which I learn that of God I know. And are not you turning over two of theſe leaves conſtantly? The <hi>Heavens</hi> in your Obſervations, and the <hi>Sea</hi> in

O then why do not you of all men, learn to fear the Lord? 2. Of all men, you ſhould learn to fear the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſee ſo much of the wickedneſs and ignorance and darkneſs of the world in other places: the ſight of other men's wickedneſs, ſhould make you more holy. You go to <hi>the dark places of the Earth</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt ſays) where <hi>their habitations are full of Cruelty;</hi> where <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> do exerciſe their Cruelty over poor Chriſtians, that are their ſlaves. Where Parents will ſell their own Children to be ſlaves, <hi>where Satan hath his ſeat,</hi> where he hath to this day, in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>India,</hi> his ſacrifices. O, how ſhould theſe things promote the fear of the Lord in you; That God hath been ſo good to you, that you ſhould have your Birth in a <hi>Goſhen,</hi> while others had theirs under <hi>Egyptian</hi> dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, look upon it as a mercy, to draw you on to fear the Lord: That you were born <hi>ENGLISH-MEN.</hi> 3. Of all men, you ſhould fear the Lord, becauſe you go through more viſible dangers then others. It is true, we are all at Land expoſed to dangers, but not ſo viſibly as you at Sea; ſo we are the leſs ſenſible of them. What? live amongſt and converſe with dangers daily, and not learn to fear God. You give Bills, and your
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100523:85"/> Relations give up Bills for you, ſuch an one going a dangerous Voyage; and indeed, it is true. But, do you by theſe dangers learn to fear the Lord?</p>
                  <p>4. Of all men you ſhould fear the Lord: you ſee ſo many periſh by the Judgments of the Lord, and ſhould not you be affraid of his righteous Judgments?

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100523:85"/> all men, Sea-men ſhould fear the Lord, and their Relations; Becauſe they are perſons of ſo many temptations. Need I tell you the Temptations you lie open to abroad? your Temptations, they are expoſed to, that ſtay at home? hath not every Country its Temptations? have not hot Countries their temptations to one ſin, and cold Countrys their temptations to another? may not you ſoon fall into uncleanneſs in the one? and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Drunkenneſs in the other? Hath not long abſence from Relations its temptation in it? have not the ſight of ſo much ſin, as you ſee committed Aboard, and abroad, a temptation in it? Hath not your Trading and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with men of ſecret ſorts and ranks, Heathens, Papiſts? and others, Turks, Jews? are there no temptations here I ſay? your Relations and Wives are exerciſed with great temptations by their fears, by your long ſtays, by ſomtimes Reports. And they had need be armed with the fear of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe things at home, as well as you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. 6. Of all men, and women, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and their Relations, ſhould fear the Lord, for you know not how ſhort your time may be together. A poor Sea-man knows not, but the next Voyage he may be cut off; and his Wife knows not, but ſhe may the next Voyage be a Widdow. How many are ſo? O then, what cauſe have you
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100523:86"/> to fear the Lord? when you part, no body can tell you of a certainty, whether you will ever meet again, or no. Nay ſure, the Lord would have Sea-men think, Their time is ſhort. Therefore the word, the Spirit of <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7. 29. <gap reason="foreign">

God</hi> is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Controverſie ſhould be taken up. O, how willing is the Lord to accept you to terms of grace and mercy upon your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and humiliation! Doth not he call upon you to lay down your weapons, to this end? doth not he ſend out his Ambaſſadors of Peace, to this end? to entreate, woe, and beſeech you to be Reconciled to him? <hi>We are Ambaſſadors in Chriſts ſtead, beſeeching you</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaies) <hi>to be reconciled unto God;</hi> doth he not complain of your obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of your obduracy under all the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous means you have to bring you upon your knees, that you may lie at the mercy of God? doth not he tell you, His arms are open, yea wide open, ready to embrace all poor guilty Souls that flie thither for mercy? 5. O be humbled for the cauſe you and your Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons give unto God, to come forth againſt you. If it be not taken up, when ever you ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack at Sea, or die at Land, you periſh; yea, you periſh for ever. Alas, what is the periſhing of a ſhip? or the periſhing of a State to the periſhing of a Soul? It may be ſaid in this caſe, as in that, <hi>Were they grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinners that were caſt away in the late ſtorm,</hi> than you? no, but <hi>Except you Repent,</hi>

                  <p>1. By <hi>Prayer:</hi> This is the great inquiry; <hi>ſhew me wherefore thou contendeſt with me:</hi> this is the only way to find out the controverſie. Thus <hi>David</hi> did, as you have heard, <hi>Search me O God, try me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s prayer found out the <hi>Achan,</hi> for God, upon it: bid him <hi>ariſe and ſearch out the curſed thing.</hi> He knew not of the accurſed thing, until he had been inquiring of God, and then all comes out. O, <hi>Prayer</hi> brings all out: As ſometimes God ſayes by Preaching, <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> as he did by <hi>Nathan</hi> unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi> ſo he ſays ſomtimes by <hi>Prayer, thou art the man;</hi> and this is the ſin; the cauſe of ſuch an evil, and of ſuch a tryal.</p>
                  <p>2. Direction: Would you find out the cauſe? then you muſt look into your ſelves, as well as look up to God, looking inward, is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as looking upward, you muſt make a diligent ſearch; you muſt <hi>commune with your own hearts.</hi> You muſt find this, if ever you find it, upon ſearch. O it is not an eaſie thing to find out the cauſe of Gods contending with us. And therefore we muſt be exact in the ſcrutiny. 1. It is, it may be, ſome hidden thing; the accurſed thing was the hidden thing; it was
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100523:98"/> not in the open field, no, it was in <hi>Achans</hi> Tent, yea, and it was hid there, therefore we muſt ranſack every corner of our hearts: they have many dark corners, and we muſt, if we will find out the cauſe, go from corner to corner, with the light of the Word. You Sea-men, ſearch your Ships, for the accurſed thing: you Land-men, ſearch your Shops for it, and every one, ſearch your hearts for it. It is not many times viſible, there is, it is true, a viſible curſed thing many times carried to Sea with you <hi>(viz)</hi> your drunkenneſs, your neglect of the worſhip of God, your ſwearing, your Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But is there not, where theſe are not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed covetuouſneſs, <hi>the accurſed wedg of gold,</hi> accurſed defrauding and cheating in a more hidden way, and accurſed uncleanneſs in a more ſecret way? that, it may be, few know of it. 2. You muſt ſearch your hearts for the cauſe of your evils. For, few know their own hearts, <hi>who knows them?</hi> it is a very hard thing to know them aright: we may think we know them, &amp; be very ignorant of them; if they that ſearch them ſomtimes, be ignorant of them, how ignorant are they then of them, that never look into them; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ</hi> 19. 12,</note> which made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>who can underſtand his error? cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults.</hi> 3. You muſt be diligent in the ſearching out the cauſes of your evils; for you may very eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look them: you may eaſily over-look in the ſearch, the <hi>wedg of gold;</hi> it may lye in a little room; <hi>and the Babyloniſh garment,</hi> may lye in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100523:98"/> a little room. 4. You muſt be diligent in the ſearches; for, our Hearts are very prone to be partial. We have a <hi>Peter</hi> within that often calls to us, <hi>Maſter ſpare thy ſelf.</hi> We ſay of a belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſin, that uſually is the cauſe of Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with us, as <hi>David</hi> did of his beloved Son, <hi>deal gently with my Son</hi> Abſolom, <hi>for my ſake.</hi> We are very indulgent to our <hi>right hands,</hi> and to our <hi>right eyes.</hi> 5. You muſt be diligent in your Search; for, while you are upon it, if it be poſſible, Satan will blow out your Candle, (I mean your Conviction) in the light of which you Search. It may be, God convinces you of your duty, and you fall upon ſearch; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have made any thing of it, you will have Satan blow your light out, and ſo you will give over; as the woman ſought her loſt groat, lighted her Candle, and ſwept her houſe; ſo, had you need to do, in this inquiry after the cauſe of your diſtreſſes, and Afflictions.</p>
                  <p>3. If you would find out the cauſe of your Afflictions, and tryals, then make Inquiery by the word. Then, is the only Rule to find out the <hi>Jonah.</hi> This way would theſe poor Heathen Mariners have taken; but that they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any ſuch Rule: therefore, they caſt Lots, There can be no ſearch made to any purpoſe, without the word. It is, upon this account, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Lamp, a Lanthorn. If a ſin, we ſeek for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade diſcovery, and run into the dark corners of our Hearts; we are to follow the ſearch ſtill in the light of the word: And, if guilty <hi>Jonah</hi> had
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100523:99"/> but been kept awake, to have askt his Soul the Queſtion, O my Soul, Is this according to the word of the Lord, that came to thee? was thy Commiſſion to go to <hi>Tarſhiſh?</hi> or to <hi>Ninevie?</hi> Is it according to Rule, for thee to go one way, when God bids thee go another? he had then ſoon come to a diſcovery of the cauſe of this ſtorm upon eaſie Inquiry. We ſhould in ſuch a caſe ſay, as <hi>Paul</hi> did in that controverſie. <hi>But what ſaies the Scripture?</hi> 1. Make your Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by reading the word. O, that Sea-men would Sail by this Compaſs! and when you meet with a ſin (ſet out in the word, and markt by the Lord) that you would ſay, Here is a Sea-marke for thee to avoyd, here is a Rock that thou muſt be careful thou ſplit not upon, a Sand thou muſt be careful thou fall not foul upon. Here is a Gulph thou muſt be careful thou be not ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in.

And O, how many are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, precious Souls of poor Sea-men caſt away in theſe Gulphs? Do you in reading the word obſerve what marks God hath given ſuch, and ſuch ſins; and how they have cauſed his diſpleaſure?

                  <p> 3. Conſult to find out the cauſe, the Word Preached. A ſearching Miniſtry may be a great bleſſing to Sea-men upon that account. The word Preached to you, is to be your Spiritual Pilots, to ſhew you where ſuch a Rock lies, ſuch a Sand lies, where ſuch a Shelve lies; we are to tell you from our Lord and Maſter, that if you ſteer a courſe of ſin, you will run a courſe of Ruine. It was the Lords Commiſſion to his Prophets, <hi>Lift up thy Voyce like a Trumpet, cry aloud and ſpare not: Shew unto my people their ſins, and the Houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>their Tranſgreſſions.</hi> We are to ſhew your ſins, as the cauſes of <hi>Gods</hi> controverſie with you. We ſhew you your danger of ſuch a Rock, ſuch a ſin; but, do you bear off? do you ſtand off from it? if you do not, at your peril; if you miſcarry, your blood be upon your own heads. O, me-thinks, of all men, Sea-men ſhould love a ſearching Miniſtry, you enjoy ſo little of it, go many months, and hear not a Sermon; you that run ſo many hazards and dangers, you love Carpenters for the ſafety of the ſhip, and Chirurgions for the health of your bodies, and why ſhould not you love Miniſters for the good of your Souls? Muſt ſhips, muſt bodies be preferr'd before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls?</p>
                  <p>4. Would you find out the cauſe, Be then often reading over your lives and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. You keep your Journals, and is it not as neceſſary to keep Diaries? The book of your lives, you may read every day, when you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100523:101"/> have time to read other books; nay, it may be ſome of you cannot read at all. O but this book you may read! and may not you often read, <hi>O Lord, my wickedneſs now doth correct me?</hi> doth purſue me; doth, as an Avenger of blood, follow me? This is thy Iniquity that teſtifies againſt thee, this is thy ſin that now hath found thee out; this is thy drunkenneſs, thy abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable uncleanneſs, thy blaſpheamous Oaths; thy mocking at Prayer; thy prophaining of Sabbaths! May not you read all this in your lives? men at Land, that would know how it is with them, as to their Eſtates, will caſt up their books; and men at Sea, that would know where they are, and what courſe they run, will keep their obſervations and watches. So, ſhould you be often caſting up your Books, your Accounts, your Obſervations, if you would know where abouts you are, for your Eternal Conditions. It may be, the <hi>Jonah</hi> is in thy Converſation, that brings the ſtorm, then thou muſt look to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that.</p>
                  <p>5. Would you find out the Cauſe? Then, you muſt ſet before you the danger of miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now they were in danger, they cry out, <hi>For whoſe cauſe is this evil come upon us?</hi> Truly we are ſeldom either at Sea, or Land, led into our duty, until danger drive us to it. In your ſtorms you are, it may be, ſaying to your ſelves, What if the ſhip ſhould miſcarry? but, do you ever ſay to your Souls, what if your Souls miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry? what if the ſhip be loſt, you ſay? but,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100523:101"/> if you ſaid, What if your Souls be loſt? this would help you in the inquiry after the cauſe of the Lords Controverſie with you. Set thy danger before thee, poor Sea-man, that thou may'ſt find out the cauſe. 1. If thy Soul miſcarry, it is an eternal miſcarriage; thou art fixed in that miſcarryed eſtate to all Eternity, never to come out of it. It is to go to the Pit, <hi>from whence there is no Redemption.</hi> There may be Redemption from <hi>Sally,</hi> from <hi>Algier,</hi> nay from <hi>Fez,</hi> where poor Sea-men, when they are taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi> are ſo affraid of being ſent. O, but poor Sea-men, from Hell, there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. The King of this Country never gives up his Slaves. 2. If thy Soul miſcarry (poor Sea-man), it will aggravate thy ſin, and miſery, that thou had'ſt ſo many warnings, but refuſed them. O, what a fair way waſt thou once in? when convinced of ſuch a ſin, would be thy Ruine, if thou did'ſt not Repent of it? ſuch a Rock would ſplit thy Soul for ever, if thou came foul upon it; and yet what a bold courſe did'ſt thou ſteer, notwithſtanding all theſe warnings. Miniſters called to thee, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions called to thee, Conſcience called to thee, Godly.

                  <p>4. That ſin, that we are moſt prone to plead for our excuſe, that uſually is the cauſe of the Controverſy betwixt God and us. And, as we are <hi>Adams</hi> children in hiding our Sin; ſo

Oh, God will unclothe ſinners, although they go in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100523:114"/> the garbe of Saints and Believers; yet the Lord will in his time let the world ſee what filthy Ulcers, and what rotten hearts they have under their goodly out-ſides; thus he did by <hi>Judas,</hi> though it was a great while firſt; as God ſays of them, <hi>They ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi>

What poor Seaman, when thou art in a foreign Country, though the

O did poor ſinners but think, ſhortly they muſt give an account of theſe actions of theirs to that God that now is a Spectator; would it not awe their ſpirits? He ſees thee now that muſt judg thee ere long. Now thou art running
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100523:116"/> on in ſin, there is no ſtopping thee; thou art Sermon-proof, and caſts the Word of the Lord behind thy back, and hateſt to be reformed; Well poor ſinner, it will but be a little while and thou ſhalt ſtand trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling before Gods Tribunal, receiving thy Sentence for theſe ſins that thou thought were ſecret, and hidden. 5. The eye of that God looks on that hath been a God of many preſervations and ſalvations to thee; who is it that gives thee thy Life every ſtorm, every Voyage, nay every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? who hath been thy old friend to carry thee out, and bring thee home again? to reſcue and redeem thee ſo many times from the very brink of the Pit?

                  <p>2. <hi>The Omniſcience of God truly ſtudied and obſerved is an argument of ſincerity, and integrity of Soul.</hi> Hypocrites act from the eye of men, both as to their ſins, as well as ſervices; they did all, it is ſaid of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees to be ſeen of men: So if the eye of man be over an unſound heart, it may be he is awed.

But there is one ſin above all we ſhould be very watchful againſt, and that is the ſin of our Complexions that we are ſo very prone to fall into: Oh the eye of God awes the Soul as to this; if it be drunkenneſs; if it be that ordinary ſin of poor Seamen, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

It is dangerous to ſtep into a ſinful way; but it is more dangerous to continue on, and walk on in it; We read of a dreadful threatning unto him that walks on in his Treſpaſſes; God will wound the hairy ſcalp of ſuch. A godly man may ſtep into a way of ſin, but he is not hence denominated an ungodly man, becauſe it is not his courſe; and ſo an

As the Stars fought againſt <hi>Siſera,</hi> ſo God can cauſe the Stars in their influence to fight againſt poor Seamen; the Stars that ſo much befriend you. God raiſes up the Sea againſt you, the Winds againſt you to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the very guilt that you go about to hide.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Poor Seamen take heed of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hiding your ſin, when God ſhall ſet it home upon you, you will then cry out ſo much the more of it. It is like poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; if it be not vomited up, the perſon dies for it; as is ſaid of ſome wicked men, <hi>They have ſwallowed down Riches, and they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 20. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall vomit them up again, God ſhall caſt them out of his belly.</hi> Thus may it be ſaid of poor ſinners, that hide their ſin from God, when Conſcience ſhall come and cauſe the ſecret poyſon to work; Oh then what Confeſſions will there be to the Lord! as <hi>David, I have ſinned: I ſaid I would confeſs my ſin, &amp;c.</hi> He did not go about now to hide it as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he had done. He had layn three quarters of a year in that fit of the Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the ſleepy diſeaſe; but now when God awakened him, Oh what Prayers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100523:121"/> and Tears doth he pour out to God! Thus <hi>Achan,</hi> though he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived <note place="margin">Joſh. 7.</note> to hide all, God you have heard brought out all, and then he confeſſes. So <hi>Jonah,</hi> here now God hath found him out, confeſſes all; it may be in a ſtorm at Sea, ſo will you do, or on a ſick bed in a ſtrange Country; ſo will you do it may be going down into the bottom; Oh then why ſhould you now go about to hide it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let poor Seamen take heed of hiding their ſin; for they think to make the Sea a hiding place to them; yet Gods right hand can reach them where ever they ſail; they cannot ſail beyond the reach of Gods right hand. Oh God will make a long arm after you, but he will find you out: Gods right hand can reach beyond the Line. <hi>Thine</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 21. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>hand ſhall find out all thine Enemies, where ever they are;</hi> at Sea, or at land, ſecret, or publick Enemies: <hi>Thy right hand ſhall find out thoſe that hate thee.</hi> Some carry it, <hi>Thy hand ſhall find vengeance for thy Enemies, for all thine Enemies.</hi> Thine hand, (one obſerves <note place="margin">Mr. Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</note> that the <hi>Chaldee</hi> reads it) the ſtroke of thine hand. Oh cannot this hand find you at the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> or the <hi>Weſt-Indies?</hi> or where ever you go? O poor ſinner, thou that at preſent doſt not feel the weight of thy own guilt, it may be ere long wilt feel the weight of Gods ſtroke.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:100523:122"/> 4. Oh let poor Seamen take heed of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their ſin, for this doth aggravate their ſin: this is to add ſin unto ſin. When men do ſin, and confeſs, and preſently are brought upon their knees for it, before the Lord; he is ready to forgive ſin. <hi>I ſaid I would confeſs my ſin, and thou forgaveſt me the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my ſin:</hi> But when men conceal and deny, Oh this aggravates and greatens it exceedingly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. O let poor Seamen take heed of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſin; for God hath ſaid, ſuch ſhall not proſper, whether they be Landmen, or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the word of the Lord ſtands ſure, <hi>They</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 28. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall not proſper.</hi> They may proſper for a while as the wicked, which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>flouriſhes like the green Bay-tree;</hi> But however he proſper in the world, he ſhall not proſper in his deſign of covering his ſins; for they ſhall be laid open and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to his ſhame; <hi>but he that confeſſes and forſakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall find mercy.</hi> You ſee <hi>Jonah</hi> had ſucceſs, and things hit with him for a while, as in finding a Ship ready to ſet ſail when he came to <hi>Joppa;</hi> yet, we ſee, he did not proſper in his deſign.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Oh let poor Seamen take heed of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding guilt, for this will bring terrible and dreadful ſtorms. Guilt uſually is a ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeder; it was ſo here with <hi>Jonah;</hi> it was <hi>Jonah</hi>'s ſecret guilt that did raiſe this ſtorm;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100523:122"/> and Oh then poor Souls, what will you do, when ready to ſink, and your hidden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned guilt looks you in the face! will not the Mariners then be afraid, the ſtout hearted Mariners? will not they then be terrors to themſelves? and terrors to all round about them? Oh what terrible Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures will Conſcience read poor guilty Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when they are in their diſtreſſes?</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is it ſo that God will find out the guilty perſon; then it is a word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to all Seamen, and other poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that they would confeſs their ſin to the Lord. I beſpeak you, and beſeech you in the language of <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Achan, My Son confeſs, and give glory to the Lord.</hi> You have heard it is in vain to hide it from him: Oh therefore come to the Lord with that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confeſſion of the Church in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s days. <hi>O Lord God of Iſrael, thou art rightoous, for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ezra 9. 15</note> 
                     <hi>we remain yet eſcaped, as it is this day; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we are before thee in our Treſpaſſes, for we cannot ſtand before thee, becauſe of this.</hi> O how many poor Seamen may ſay we are yet eſcaped; eſcaped ſuch a ſtorm, ſuch a fatal tempeſt unto others, and yet we are before thee in our Treſpaſſes, and cannot ſtand with comfort and confidence before the Lord, becauſe they have again broken his Commandments after their eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100523:123"/> and ſalvations: And that you may fall down before the Lord in humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, conſider theſe following Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is uſually the beginning of a kindly effectual touch of grace upon the heart: The poor Prodigal upon his firſt return unto his Father, ſays, <hi>Father, I have</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 15. Act. 19. 18</note> 
                     <hi>ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee;</hi> his firſt work upon his return is Confeſſion. We read of a great ſucceſs the Goſpel had in <hi>Paul</hi>'s day, <hi>and many believed;</hi> and as ſoon as the Goſpel touched kindly their Souls, they confeſſed, and ſhewed their deeds, (ſaith the Text) <hi>viz.</hi> laying their hainous ſins by way of humble confeſſion, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, ſo it will be with a poor ſinner, <hi>As a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke,</hi> he confeſſed he had been. Lord, will the poor Soul ſay, what a vile wretch have I been; with <hi>Paul, of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners I am chief;</hi> a Blaſphemer, a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an injurious perſon. When <hi>Paul</hi> was humbled, Oh how he confeſſes then, what a wretch he had been!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This puts poor Souls under a promiſe. O now upon thy knees poor ſinner, while thou art confeſſing thy ſin, thou mayeſt put into plea and ſuit Gods promiſe; and Oh what an excellent way is this of dealing with God, to be bewailing your ſin, and at the ſame time be pleading Gods promiſe for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100523:123"/> pardon; this is right Evangelical repentance to have one eye upon ſin to humble you; and another eye upon the promiſe to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you up to believe your pardon: uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally legal ſorrow keeps an eye upon guilt, but forgets to keep an eye upon the Promiſe. Now poor Soul it is thy only way to confeſs under a Promiſe, <hi>If we confeſs</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> Oh now he is engaged as a faithful God, to pardon poor ſouls: Oh Faithfulneſs is his name, and he will not, nay, cannot deny his name; and now he can be juſt in the pardoning, as well as in the puniſhing of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Motive to Confeſſion of ſins: you have comfortable preſidents upon record, of great ſins, and ſinners pardoned upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, nay, upon the ſerious purpoſe of humble confeſſion: We read of Gods rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to pardon, even in a caſe of great guilt; this we have in <hi>David, I ſaid I would confeſs my ſin, and thou forgaveſt me the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my ſin;</hi> which was a piece of guilt highly aggravated, and circumſtantiated. <hi>Mary</hi> that was ſuch a poor Penitent that we <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 4. 47.</note> read, ſhe waſhed the feet of Chriſt with her Tears; (and muſt not here be moſt eminent Confeſſions poured out with theſe Tears?) And it is ſaid of her, <hi>Her ſins that are many</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100523:124"/> 
                     <hi>are forgiven her, for ſhe loved much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Motive to Confeſſion of ſin; if you deny it, it will be proved againſt you; and Oh what a folly is it for a Priſoner to deny the fact before the Judg, when he knows it will be proved againſt him. <hi>Thou haſt ſet our iniquities before thee, our ſecret ſins in the light</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 90. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>of thy Countenance.</hi> As it is the comfort of Gods people that he keeps a Book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their Sufferings: So it is the terror of wicked men that he keeps a Book of Remembrance of their ſins. There is the Conſcience of the poor ſinner will be called in as Gods witneſs againſt the guilty Malefactor at the Barr; that is an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place in the Prophet, <hi>We roar all like Bears, and mourn ſore like Doves; we look</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 59. 11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>for Judgment, but there is none; for Salvation, but it is far off from us: For our Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are multiplied before thee, and our ſins teſtifie againſt us.</hi> They did bear Teſtimony againſt them. Oh poor Seamen, have not you many times in your extremities and diſtreſſes at Sea, felt the terror of this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? have not the iniquities of your heels compaſſed you about?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Motive to Confeſſion of ſin. <hi>The King of Iſrael is a merciful King;</hi> It is this merciful King tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Soul preſents it ſelf before in humble Confeſſion. This was the motive to the Servants of <hi>Benadad, We have</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:100523:124"/> 
                     <hi>heard that the King of Iſrael is a merciful King; and they came with Ropes about their necks.</hi> Oh poor Souls, if you come to this merciful King with ropes about your necks, Confeſſing you deſerve to be turned off the Ladder, and to have a righteous ſentence executed upon you, he will meet you with a Pardon in his hand. This King ſits upon a Throne of Grace upon the Mercy-ſeat, giving out his Pardons daily to humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents. Now we read that the Book of the Law, which contains all in it, all poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Enditements, it was put into the Ark, and the Mercy-ſeat covering it was above it. Oh this was ſhadowed out by it. Mercy triumphs over Juſtice in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Oh then poor ſinners bring your Confeſſions to the Mercy-ſeat.</p>
                  <p>Oh let all poor guilty Seamen, and all other poor guilty ſinners confeſs their ſins over the head of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Prieſt was to confeſs all the iniquities of <note place="margin">Exod. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> the people over the head of the Scape-Goat; noting to us, that we muſt take Chriſt into our Confeſſions; all poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Confeſſions, ſhould fall upon the head of Chriſt. Now poor ſinners, and poor guilty Seamen, ask your own Conſciences, Whether you had not better carry your Guilt before the Lord in humble Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100523:125"/> than have the Lords juſt and righteous lot find it out, either to the confuſion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of your immortal precious Souls. O let this Text never be forgotten by you when you come under Sea-temptations, or Land-temptations. <hi>Oh, but the Lot fell upon Jonah.</hi>
